Not huge portions, but enough to keep you full and delivers on taste. Also many options which makes it hard to choose butMy girlfriend and I visited Jack’s Wife Freda in SoHo for a late breakfast after reserving a 10:45am table, and it was the perfect brunch experience. We sat in the outdoor dining area. Seating was a bit cozy, but the atmosphere was lively and welcoming.

Had Jacks breakfast and would have ate more had it been there but for $30 felt like a lot of value.  Jasmine tea was really good and brewed in pot.  Service was friendly and helpful.Good spot for brunch! The staff is kind and tries to be attentive, but the place gets very busy, so it’s hard to get consistent attention — we were helped by three different servers during our visit. It’s also quite loud, which makes it a bit hard to relax.

The food, service, sexy ambiance and incredible hospitality make this one of New York’s best restaurants. We went against most reviews and didn’t orI’ve heard mixed reviews but I loved it! The food was imaginative and delicious. The space was lush and lively and they were playing all the R&B hits from the late 90’s.

Pan Asian kitchen very flavorful and well designed on the plate which really open our appetite. we started with chicken skewers , Fried chicken Papaya salad  and beef tartare, we hI really wanted to like the spot, but the fusion aspect left me very confused about each dish. Everything just tasted a little bit different than I expected or wanted it to, and I felt like the flavors just didn’t jive for me. The service was very nice and the restaurant is beautiful. It’s great forSuch a cute spot with good food and vibes! Our server was amazing - she knew the menu really well and gave great recommendations which we appreciated. We ordered several things she recommended, including the crab fried rice, which was 10/10! Drinks were really good as well.Love this place! Great vibes, flavorful food, and excellent service. The dishes are always interesting. I accidentally spilled my drink and they replaced it right away. The dessert was delicious too. I keep coming back!5 stars for Angela, she's very cool, friendly & accommodates us with the menu. Great service 👍

The food was OK. Some were not bad, and others were blends.

The cafe has such a cute and charming atmosphere, and the staff are some of the friendliest you'll meet. Our food was delicious, and I especially loved my Shakshuka—it was packed with flavor. Great food, great people, and a great vibe. What more coulWe loved Little Collins, 10/10. My husband and I ate here 5 mornings while visiting New York.

The queue moves very quickly (15min wait) so don’t let that put you off eating here. The earlier you get here, the better…we were here before 10am each morning.

Recommend: eggs benny+bacon, scrambled eggsA must go for breakfast in the mid manhattan area. Phenomenal espresso and hand squeezed OJ. Breakfast menu is small and everything we had was fantastic.

11,Bibble & Sip,"One of my absolute favorite dessert spots in NYC, and truly the best cream puffs you’ll find in the city!

Their baked goodies are uniquely clever and delicious: I totally fell for the “soup dumpling cake,” which looks like a savory snack but is actually a sweet, fluffy masterpiecI stopped by Bibble Coffee Shop right after my morning jog, and it was the perfect treat. Their iced latte totally hit the spot, and the pastry I grabbed was so fresh. Such a cozy place to relax and recharge — I’ll definitely be making this part of my routine!Got four puffs to share with friends. My favorite is the matcha one. You gotta try it. Oreo one is the least fav. The puff is so crunchy and full of flavor. Not too sweet and very delicious. Early grey is also amazing.Busy Asian bakery in the theatre district! You must stop by for a treat when you’re in the area. Desserts are beautifully decorated and not super sweet compared to American desserts. Drinks are also very unique.

I tried thCoffee Project in the East Village is a small, modern spot with a Euro-café vibe (bonus points for the no-laptop policy). Their medium-roast blend—Colombia meets Guatemala—hits a sweet spot: smooth milk-chocolate body with a caramel finish, zero bitterness, and plenty of flavor.

I ordered an almondI've tried a lot of coffee shops in NYC, and this place takes #1 for best tasting coffee/drinks! And don't get me started on the incredible latte art.

I go here about once per week, and it's always a treat. I've never had a drink I disliked, and can highly recommend the ube delight, cappuccino, vanWe ordered pour over and nitro flight. The special Colombia natural pour over had  watermelon and lollipop notes, but $15 is very pricy even compared to San Francisco. The nitro flight is interesting but the beans used is probably not the best, so the taste is a little flat.

Next time i want We walked in at around 10 am and the wait time was 15 min inside or immediately outside … we were heading to the airport and decides to not risk it so we got sited outside and it was super windy that day so definitely we didn’t have the best time with all the dust flying around us and the food.

TheWe came here our first morning in the city. We liked everything so much we started each day here.
My son loved their breakfast sandwich and eggs benes with french ham. The lattes were so good and very good pretty. All of the staff was friendly and made us feel welcome.Fantastic experience! The food and drinks were all delicious, and the servers were all very friendly and attentive (especially Jacqueline!). Everything we got was beautifully plated and tasted wonderful. My boyfriend and I were in the city for 4 days and loved it so much we came back twice.I came all the way from Texas and chose In Common for brunch  and what a beautiful experience it was! Despite the long line outside, the service moved quickly and smoothly. The waitresses were efficient, kind, and full of good energy.

15,787 Coffee Co.,"Chill coffee shop with great espresso and plenty of areas to relax or work in. Big fan of the Coquito latte. Love the mix of coconut and cinnamon. Their chicken empanadas are a delicious snack. Love the tables up on the second floor. Super chill and I got to spend a couple hours working there. Will A cool place with lots of seating. Eclectic furniture on the first and second floors. I would come here way more often if it weren’t for their strange pricing. When you order a latte, they make you choose from one of the three specialty beans, even when you didn’t ask for it. It adds $3 to the bill.Walking by and in search of a great cup of coffee with a place I could sit, work, and enjoy the people - I stumbled across 787. It was exactly what I had hoped for.

The Puerto Rican coffee with rum was recommended to me by the barista - and it was delicious. Smooth, decadent, and fully-leaded (the LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Their coffee is absolutely amazinggg and sooo smooth. I took home some of their coffee beans (of course not as good as they make it) and it made such a difference in my at home coffee routine! My favorite is their Coquito coffee!!I dropped by this coffee shop for a networking event hosted by the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science community.

16,Urban Backyard,"A nice quaint coffee shop on the edge of Soho. Customer service is friendly and welcoming. More importantly, the coffee is great. Seating inside, downstairs and on the quiet street that it's on. Worthy of stopping in.Wonderful coffee and espresso drinks with a pastry selection.  They have absolutely adorable cupcakes that look like real succulents- so creative!  They have the typical flavors plus some originals like black sesame latte. The space is totally cute and they have a basement that you enter from outsidBest coffee in NYC. I ordered an oat iced latte. Good amount of milk (some places add too much and you can’t taste the coffee). Lovely seating area outside and friendly staff - come here for your morning iced latte!Such a cute place and with super sweet staff. Had a great iced latte and the sweets looked really good. A nice place to chill for a bit and get good coffee.It’s a small space but great vibes here! The iced latte was perfect, and the cookies are solid. There’s some seating, a lot of plants and well decorated.","{'casualness': 0.8, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.3, 'elegance': 0.5, 'authenticity': 0.3}",0.95,"180 Mulberry St, New York, NY 10012, USA",,5,"[{'height': 1406, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115989726639778555114"">Ivan</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU483Mg98vNfDIvbQPa-7V-1Q3ApACfnL2tcHFSHV8TcT9E16INHhqpFjBTCXyGfrpQRn25N5G1nxvxV4Rv2d5HGOKeiVzrmHv6LDK_vBltqBmBJV6UykWumCN5EMjYrIL8kUM1DzAmYiJBV_dCoO56rAiQUQtA3vvOPUnb2LYJG1LlFk5EnW3jBXTC69yFd90kVOtkWhQCOn7AEIM7lLVaPvVFlup5-8CWeqQHu6hrzUzVAcQFC6nOqOz1UYz9IxniCefI-VHsmN-MySDPBiel0N8eVlJYzgq59dGdNvNWmfvjb2JRiscpU0zvOQGOHZAJ0N6ZKpwTmDK1UdlRny8wgLBtVi_0I9bGOJMsUVBukhBUUG7t0gThdnDPcnLKL4CMtCU5BtN4Zvjfl9Opuzugalr1T1QQTOWmWIRBIZXsD7LbV', 'width': 1126}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116265986923046823547"">Cara Guo</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6C50ZAn5AUQRGhSwgqyUoR-FVtfyXoxqDl7muNoQEvc89Rat1PS1sDmBuoSolP9KBjnrZoQX5NiivOVPP9_p2HrxYc32lHrbtcdCU3mXnkTNLVFd22Iat-4Q-9lKsGaZuivPmUWAPVwNFxc-5RSnGkQxuYCAxwehpJ-UMY-OEItraKPsUGNASFzgoS91-7c6SRnWNhmAadYSUGwZ37XEs80qpBTlL_T8Uefrkrhfjir6vq5QlEggThO7qlnGvl-sLQ_rexKerwLvOOpvdKnAf5Oh7GSYSDJMvOXq0Xg33_jKW21VmDCTy4Dqw6HZh_qCyh0MLBC-P_pj0Z6sAewl5v9nMLyGh0JTJ0yCsX6AHDqO4P9g3UBwDUmQ7V_I2iTOpwxicUo8v-z-l7-S-V9FiJlY-R_C9NPrCGkaW_2BhR4aAK', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100401051421129108453"">Maxime Scheffer</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7svhiEdPnJsS4lyiPhUCTffG-7TqpEmJp6GXlusJ_ZfSCxF5B7XvdoHo616zAjQAiK0Tv8ivMaSsF6SDItl1LJJUvTHUAcVSJZisKfkYT6R65uoDT1fJYiYxPCOFUlG_g9YGyOzF2vSH_yW_h9mGqxnCVPG2WoyD-8vRbpECEP5WqfKDzRt_2g5pwI9i6lrY2LAP1tebpKkU-3WgzvihrFP-f0GMDRM5cWCAR6lTUiZ36jsKTmRuqSHaGpbX5KFtPxc-Hnf-JrdK5ITnSaRDxEBFt6c0oCxRgDMlSUUdsn1x3MOw3s5OOaMaCV9ie38SCIAtj7yRwBE-CBFiONAuJyxFa0Lp9yGGaD9yS-DEMlqFnfFJkcGGn_SxfFcBW_QzktksGj6NxSZX32PbU74pOTO-iw8tn_avfZsOySyYbiyl8', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116622516592328866369"">Bill Wang</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6AzNTgd_lOkuX_E1F-IwD8WhMAbGjL2gK6qrUe9MO5_N8W6LzUv_bx-UBsjahxz7ppBCIUQG6dVPgF38Tp5aGC8H7Od4XRRezUpGnPRkm3UYaiLw0Sug6Sn8t4JDrKuXXnSAm4ObHobPinzntqa-zUmMK_ssl6GrEipumRtDiON_6UPrQh5lSXXtQnW9xXMEDVRXv68gubuqsoVDWex_L6AS2ac5i_tDDOZyJfBQ8wNuCcZexJOAjCGwLsWStP_tpZKkYoMidPMDjSiXHi-EOQiBHxeEQPB5MKLzromV6mGV3rlH7w_fe44TC0P5q9HjCvA18cTnoWHYROa9nZ5gAmGAO6XjT7DKzdX8iAAgwuRDbM-wQxjldnbE75pXZgua2l5LCwVasUU5jEHezGpLq3w86ptV9Iu1ErBiqic0jftA', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107744915135669051280"">Katrin Rau</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6mtKgtkiSEfOshdc_w7uxr0Mf6tLqtvxNp-vK4KJjO9k1Sb_hWWlpfNH4Ni3QtZIFZgeQe_hUJVzDl3QDkODPrbqsrodr7gI_XyEPE2xA6E5VOQNa0etpIMBt0WzZWUrhUwSzTV4322dI6EkAVMUwgyzicGU1XJT_bdkYfYCxQVMeTO3xweNdnj-6r8KxLpQoOkYtgM1ZFisgi_848f2gio-gc2sIEi1Xk_NqtmCnnsDXviXzWVlqa5_lhNORmIXbrlkiq-opnIYlgJk8eH1s0fiZL3mOObr8UxYe_UzyTtNRMBA2Z91PKprtLQ7eMtSvmo7cw8ry3sAOTe2oZFe12zz6L5u78oruXqI6nA__7Mv-sxZo9Cbrbu-SGS-Wo8IUihSMpxVMUraTsu3ZUkiM05dut3Q6xKzSlu_11sffM8Ja2HHPbJEV0BlyaTC7j', 'width': 3024}]"
17,Charlotte Cafe,"Lovely staff, great coffee and peaceful ambience. You can sit outside in nice weather or at a table inside right by the table for a nice view.
Update: Stopped in today again and had the Mixed Berry start. So delicious. Light as air and not overly sweet. Perfect iced coffee and a lovely l, cozy spot First and foremost, the staff were so friendly and kind! They were nice and patient with the kids running around the store and gave me a free replacement of my drinks when they fell on the floor.

Thank you so much! Super amazing service.

My friend said the iced cold brew is very strong, very good.A quick Google search led us to pop into Cafe Charlotte on our last morning of visiting NYC. We tried a couple of recommendations (from the friendliest owners) that ended up being some of the best coffee I’ve ever had (pistachio latte, dirty chai, espresso shot). The coffee was spot on in flavor, goEveryone here is absolutely magnificent. The food is to die for and the drinks in the morning are fantastic. Everyone here is so friendly. Albana is fantastic she's a ray of sunshine. She's gets to know her customers very well and always does her best to make sure everyone feels fantastic while theySuch a wonderful hidden gem!! I was staying at a friend's apartment a few blocks away, so we headed here for a quick pick-me-up each morning I was visiting. The cafe is super cozy and way more spacious than I would've expected for NYC.

18,Gold coffee,"I was walking around this area one day and decided to stop in at the Gold Coffee to check it out.  Online reviews were very positive.
I got an americano and a pastry and found a stool at the counter by the window.  Coffee was excellent and the pastry was good.  Reasonable number of small tables and Fantastic place to get breakfast. Lovely ambiance as well. We ordered avocado toast (the best ever!), nutella banana crepe and bagel sausage egg, and cheese sandwich with coffee. We really enjoyed the food.
Apart from the above mentioned, they have varieties of hot and cold coffees, matchas, bagels,It was a decent place. Light meals, coffees, and some sweets. Some seats available, good place for short stay.

Cappuccino was ok. Watery but the taste was good.

East Village. Classic Death & Co ambiance—dimly lit, intimate, and sleek. The space feels like an upscale basement speakeasy, with a moody, timeless design and a striking backbar. The crowd is diverse and lively, though the music volume can make conversation challenging at times.
Went for a last minute drink at 11pm on a Saturday. The wait for 2 was reasonable, given how busy the venue was inside.  As we sat down we were quickly given menus and spoken to by a bartender. Cocktails were nice with a generally interesting flavor profile. Cookies were delicious, and appeared to bHad a great time at Death & Co. The cocktails were top-notch - expertly crafted and full of unique flavours. The atmosphere was stylish and inviting, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. Definitely a must-visit for anyone who loves quality cocktails.I’ve been waiting for years to come to Death & Co., ever since I randomly found and bought their first book in 2019.

Even on a weekday evening, it was quite noisy inside, which made it a bit hard to have a relaxed conversation.

Hidden in the Grand Central station you find this amazing & stunning bar. It was not crowded when we arrived on Sunday afternoon. Few people stopped by to have a look. Drinks were delicious and pricing was good.
The bar is just amazing from a design point of view.Rumor has it that this used to be Vanderbilt office?   Din. Dark. High ceilinged!!!!  The vibe is mysteriously cool.   Bar is standing only.  Tables are stacked in neat rows

Drinks are made meticulously and the noise level is appropriate for conversation. Proximity to grand central a plus.

26,Old Town Bar,"Old Town Bar is the perfect after-work hangout! The cocktails are delicious—well-crafted and full of flavor. The atmosphere is lively yet relaxed, making it a great spot to unwind with friends or coworkers. Classic charm, good vibes, and great drinks—definitely a favorite in the area!This was my first visit and I have to give it a perfect score because the staff and the food was amazing. The cheeseburger was top-notch, and the coleslaw was definitely in the top five I've ever had! Next time you're in New York, make sure you visit this iconic spot and top off your meal with a ManWhen a place has been around since the 19th century is now both queer & vegan friendly, that says something! We enjoyed delicious local beer on tap and each person had the exact burger they wanted. The servers were attentive and kind - food came fast and was all made fresh. Definitely stop by here nNice late night spot. Kitchen closes at 11:30pm.

Buffalo wings were generous in portion but a little too spicy for our liking! It's otherwise pretty good.

Key lime pie (Thursday special) was pretty nice.

Overall great service though. Worth a stop by.

P.S. People aren't kidding about large urinalOne of the oldest pubs in NYC!

We had other drinks and food that was delicious!  Then they come out with two desserts that just topped the evening off!  Staying at the ArtezeThis is a great multi-story location with an intimate setting. Space is at a premium but very accommodating, if you have a party greater than 2 it is recommended to make a reservation. The food is a great quality and comes out quick and the drinks are incredible. The bartenders are masters at their Amazing experience in a stunning place!

28,Rooftop Bars NYC,"It was stunning experience for me. The views and atmosphere were incredible-amazing people are super nice, great way to socialize with each others in a relaxed environment. Left me with a landmark in my heart 🤭. In addition, people who come from different cultures -countries are more friendly and reWe had a good time here, we could enjoy spectacular view of New York city from Roof Top bar. We did not have any reservation, but were able to find a table. Place was busy, by the time we got our fries and nachos, it was kind of cold. Other than that it is a good place to visit to enjoy the view.Really nice place, just be sure to show up before kitchen close (10pm) if yo want to eat, the drinks are cute and taste ok. The view is amazing. And yo can take so many nice pictures. 9/10Great rooftop to go to and hang out whether it’s a date or just hanging with friends. There’s a dance floor downstairs, I never stay down there tho cause it’s always packed and I’m not about that mess but everyone seems to be having a good time. Drinks are mid.

From start to finish, the pacing was perfect as the courses flowed naturally without ever feeling rushed or drawn out, which made the evening feel effortless and immersive. The staff was incredibly attentive andWhat an amazing restaurant! The food was absolutely spectacular. The bread, the meat and the corn dish! This would be a five star review if it was just about the food and the service, but it is a two star Michelin restaurant so the expectations are high.

2,Rich Table,"Porcini donuts were great -- with the raclette 😋😋😋
Sea urchin spaghetti was also quite nice though I didnt notice the sea urchin too much. They also had watermelon with a tom kha sauce on it which made for a great combo. Chicken liver was too sweet for me. Everything else was mostly pretty good, exRich Table offers exceptional service, and every bite was a true delight. Everything we were served was a culinary adventure, paired with excellent wines. It’s not cheap, but absolutely worth the price. A wonderful experience with outstanding service, and we would love to return.Loved the food! Nothing was groundbreaking, but all of the flavors were fresh and delicious and seasonal w/ fun combinations. The atmosphere of the restaurant was a little more casual and rustic than I would’ve liked, but I went for the earliest seating (maybe it’s more vibey in the dark?). Overall We took Michael to Rich Table for his birthday since it’s his favorite restaurant in SF.
We opted for the family menu, and every dish was delicious and generously portioned. The staff was also very thoughtful in accommodating our vegetarian friend—they really made sure everyone was taken care of.

TAmazing experience! Was grateful that there was a table available. Interesting take on food that will leave you talking about your flavor experiences!

3,Bottega,"Their mushroom truffle pizza is a must-try! The mozzarella and truffle was magic on first bite. I added arugula and anchovy in mine which made it even more bomb. Love their “build your own” pizza and pasta concept and the open seating made me feel like being in Europe.I absolutely adore this place! I walked in and immediately felt like I was transported to Italy. The gentleman that seated my friend and I was so kind and welcoming. All of the wait staff were helpful attentive throughout our dinner.

The food was excellent! We got the pizza with Kalamata olives on A solid authentic Italian eatery. Pasta is freshly made daily. We had the truffle croquettes and fried calamari to start. Both were good. The calamari was a bit chewy. I had the Potato Gnocchi with Vodka Pink sauce. It's hard to find great Gnocchi, this one is very good. Soft with a slight bite. Came here just for a drink and dessert (the red velvet cake) and it was perfect. The server was amazing, and the vibe was great for people-watching —they give you delicious free bread such a nice way to close out a Sunday night. I’d definitely come back!They took such a good care of us! Exceptional food quality, keeping the authentic Italian family atmosphere. You can truly taste the care in every ingredient.

4,Sotto Mare,"Absolutely stunning seafood bistro!!! Excellent service from hostess to Fabbie! Great recommendation on the white white Fabbie and thank you for your lovely and welcoming ways!!! Bravo to you!! The food was scrumptious. We ordered starters of octopus salad and shrimp cocktail salad which was refreshCame here because of many good reviews but left disappointed, perhaps my expectation was too high. Service is quick but the neither the host or server smiled at us once, the only one that did was the burst boy. The place definitely has a vibe but we just felt uncomfortable because everyone looked soBEST FOOD IN SF.

The food was incredibly delicious. We went like a week ago and I still dream about it till
now. We got the smoked salmon pasta (which was recommended to us) and it did not disappoint, my favourite dish for sure.
We also got the Seared scallops, linguini with promodoro and shrimp anSotto Mare is definitely worth going to while in San Francisco, but be prepared to wait during peak times! We waited over an hour, but it was well worth it. If you have a long wait time, I recommend trying a slice of pizza from Golden Boy next door while you wait.

Highly recommend the Catfish & Grits and watermelon iced tea. The beignets are filling. The fried chicken has good seasoning, but on the greasy side. Friendly staff and We had the catfish and fried chicken Benedict, grillades and grits and the bananas fosters french toast. The portions are all shareable, and that we did!

We loved it so much that we came back the next morning to try their peach waffles but unfortunately it was a bit disappointing.

The quality of the food exceeds my expectations. Even the coffee… OMG, it’s amazing!
The service is always outstanding. The staff is incredible, from the kitchen to the servers; everyone is Wow, our server was so helpful and kind. The food spoke for itself. Absolutely delicious.

8,State Bird Provisions,"Fun experience with dim sum cart style dining. Service was great, staff were friendly.

Small bites were good but not memorable:
- Oysters: play of texture between the crunchy kohlrabi kraut and oyster
- Smoked trout dip: good balance of acidity, savory, and creamy
-Tofu and shiitake: loved the shiiLovely dining experience but unfortunately the food left much to be desired. I’m not in a rush to come back. If I do, I’d only order from the trays and make sure to get bubbly drinks. Although they do take walk-ins, I’d recommend making reservations.

+ Interesting concept, though they no longer useI love the concept, though a bit problematic. You can expect from the menu what they would serve carted out of the kitchen, but the eyes can be hungrier than your stomach at times. You got full from the first few dimsum style serving that didn’t really do it for you and you wonder if the last few onState Bird Provisions was a unique experience, although the price is high (over $60 per person) for the experience and food quality.

The Californian Japanese fusion with a dim sum style in a cool, relaxed atmosphere. Could be great for friends but might not be the best choice for a date.

It's a goI love bringing friends and family here so they can experience State Bird, and I’ve been here four times. If you’ve ever been to a dim sum place, it’s a similar concept where food is rolled around on carts, except instead of dumplings, you’ll find things like oysters, garlic bread with burrata, and ","{'casualness': 0.7, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.4, 'authenticity': 0.7}",0.8,"1529 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA",3.0,5,"[{'height': 756, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111269326054420082526"">State Bird Provisions</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4gXYdC826dhT1v-bFsznUFbkQcErmlZuxS0K3oufC5iYCPVfaDWWFS5U_BsjsaSZ-GLqjg03CyQc3cM-dkg52u9JAgNCrN4Tbqse45d-vBoumpRoZdQ-SXPeYEfVnAxzvd7vWj-BzfQHW8Q_6A7gutWk73R31OYPip0o2s6z6Vi075DEvAUNklY06Vx67y-FDo-uLg-eBitQf162McB2TFPYSR0J9Ct-L84k2LQAJli7ydG-jpwakBYJJsWDRJ50b_AbsZ2L-cPhixp4n5HWS-COCDxYuJUCY56eniKJKY-A', 'width': 1134}, {'height': 640, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111269326054420082526"">State Bird Provisions</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5iLYnB5O_aCbm_F2SUV2Q5JEW76Xk94EiDZtvZlrXeFVmAvZO48cQZc6LzYAGBjt51jAD0qhAC0cnMeSo8Xk3eBxUfI3HKkNBFvoJny7hlvYXmX281gih18i0J3ojnx3i8gamAS_1Nv2SAcbqr_FzxqiBiQ3jqVzRO1uE_Cm05LnonbdlmLpEHvPIX-LIhxOkpTUWfv2oU66i3Y5APnyOhYopoMUBv5sT274VwTCvQVjjKfl8V6j6fynwhIAoTahC4pvdaLF62uuIsS4Na-omLpQyCq5IhTp__wIGX74Jh8g', 'width': 640}, {'height': 2644, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110900912013684923072"">Kim Pham, Pharm.D.</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6YsIBUK8o7S8WppEEwYzr3GZ9nJmaEC8FEH0B6m6_nLrdhywlUiMDioZQn185MRkDxXJ6jUId3wj2byY7ri0ZzlCPqkA7cyGV9f8XH_AhQI_1lWxhJhp_OJ9crqZie6aizR435WVheFtpvcPvgKUELcyVubTrBOtChBb6EmPvkk55F3nudoZU_bTPcqV-vUB-6beDy7wfZlKKN--mVfm6VDbxCuHh6ZWlASnNB1VFXDfoIuDiIxcVW0mfxabXH3mhmBdEUMGlHQbUN9xTT3qerv6C6V_8LdrGg0idfwkA17fh67jI-p1KkXKTr_45r8j9w0Vd5muPYOWH4ohLvKtjUo8NZYaGB_KYhnl9o8Jd-MwHR_DriyCD9JBpoC3Azw4Kdjc9bUwXGem_gZRT0wb0JipLyyn96IKlzmHt7EiGqBhHDVUvswI5z16swsg', 'width': 3526}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103606652350488184430"">Patrick Chen</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5pWbXA2k19BOUlvUvQqk88ZYbFKelJJXFJj56cM9DsW7HV_S8aLh3o0UM04F_m_kASHgwu1hP53socejZxp6YJEtao37DH6qYnyV3cvmF9n-9KGIYwcXzEyKltIHchqyZta7XZFhIHjLYDNjBMyAKwSu9ok6g1bvB9u8Wo16G6nDgzL4TMe4sZcAjy95OQcJdxX76KSsTWTR3vSAwQHMebhZetbrQOhxm9MeLDaEfG8rfXKPixWlom2MFXCVENgV3ELTpWMwoFIYUPQtDnOP8JrV1nA45f44ravF92Z7mYiZcGMqmajvMN2vGZA_TBroWVosqI33uqRqmfC4hdVdgOAOuXT0tBu04tzCLIEokppYfANMFMdb4Xn9QdrHu5WLYOUwyQxBM1WG4F0XUOQ9nbpOt327sGnGaRzpFfjVfAGHlF', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 3072, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112072539489267075432"">FILOSTRATO57</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU50EnbfH8DaUncalRotgVnTVLwfWEDbra3twprm8JvX2Lp9Lpyd8wigq8ChT9lEdQLc2yqzT3FJn5xC9OYNXkjZy73to7m1z6fuQc6drLQaQWXmZ-JTOtnS7xF57JJOREC631_5G8MeN80unJUOSm1fpQ_wmvnNEY1i7pVWXJy7vNDfXw8u7gSvydeba34AdytyluJcaJpHPp64jCycFeHarPIPlgE1uMkxxfYF61Wv60JHV7oCCD1mnWfb0WSgH4yNruLODpSVAzJ_S0KpvrOXKXn30Up43elAw-xUex3BIn9-eUbCdXB0EJhqnm6bfMhMgachoUu-KbpT_3NB9VGkzZPLF4ZuCvnZgXkDhVbIFpTFpAW-VmlRmgw0qWKpKreo7MgeNUQmniCNyCZrpCAM2CoVQsjcNud4rvoqW3dngQaTo4LyY1uQJAamVNcU', 'width': 4096}]"
9,Wayfare Tavern,"Our fifth anniversary was nothing short of magic, and Wayfare Tavern made it unforgettable. ✨

From the moment we walked in, we were met with warmth and grace—three heartfelt “Happy Anniversaries” from the host, our server, and even as we paid the bill. That kind of attention doesn’t just make a dinWayfare Tavern is such an incredible spot for a wedding reception — timeless, cozy, and filled with that signature San Francisco charm. The atmosphere is warm and intimate, with the perfect mix of elegance and comfort. The food is phenomenal (truly some of the best I’ve ever had at a wedding!), and I’ve been to Wayfare Tavern several times before and have loved each experience until last night.

We were seated promptly at our reservation time which was great, however it then took took 10 minutes before anyone talked to us or got us any water. Not the end of the world, but things didn’t exactlyI had an amazing lunch at Wayfare Tavern’s new location on Pine street today with two colleagues who are also in the hospitality industry.

A great place to enjoy delicious grilled food — highly recommended!Came here because of its reputation, and I’m glad I did. Caffe Trieste has a timeless charm—warm, slightly nostalgic, and full of character. The atmosphere invites you to slow down and enjoy your coffee, surrounded by photos and history. The espresso was rich and bold, just how it should be.

Just aCafe Trieste: A Personal Landmark in the Heart of North Beach

Having spent the last 30 years in North Beach, Cafe Trieste has become a significant part of my daily life. It was one of the first places I discovered when I moved into the neighborhood, and naturally, it quickly became one of my go-to So glad we decided to stop here after dinner in the North Beach. All the reviews led us here and they were spot on.

This is an icon in SF. We read that it’s been here for a long time and the original owner was a city celebrity. Walking in the shop we saw all the pics on the walls of the history, alLook no further! You’ve found the best espresso in town. Vibes can’t be beat. Don’t even get me started on the cannolis, couldn’t get enough of these! I talk about them all the time. Loved everything about this place.","{'casualness': 0.8, 'comfort': 1.0, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.3, 'authenticity': 1.0}",1.0,"601 Vallejo St., San Francisco, CA 94133, USA",1.0,5,"[{'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['Photos are copyrighted by their owners'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU40DGA_OJ3_GHtklQZWGhguxbYP5T0LzGG9GbyMWx_UlePKWTst32tSiE9OiSRSArYrLy-Db8dhj1UZJXuek-bCsYPUPufqyOmixo75BW2Df_A2CLvt9xxBEUMcSfXUnpJwHfYQoPsyddaMuiaeGOucfY1XDH4Aabo5ML0uWaR3GKY-qYkFjYsD6HT4hvnBCpZLbE4BjCow0Mq4G6qYq_j9_e5mcCc180W2Wn18lcv1iHlgU6i2r4D29mulDOeXsbNxcG3Shu7dy5JG0rowrc9ckSrNz4-csq4qkCvi-wm9-fe1HmNlmmmzxqfsixWqJ3Lar77PUw4A2Di1NkkSghLHd3SEh_OHeMrth38H33O-kjDUgQIguT6tc72R0WIyrsZAxxBKJCozentjFyRFW4zU_RcGJH0ychTlOPEQBQnYwg', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4624, 'html_attributions': ['Photos are copyrighted by their owners'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6F7pqJ9OixcJV6dedX532Uh86KiKUwhj3V2i8QUEm1DmRpljsD8CKjHJn8EHUSwc3vg3_2xEyFcaUcjdyEsX3dpOKJTXc9Jo8b_H08qnXiTlivtKtdR--6rB5yUAZZR-rqvocApoQpzimaJv8-oFgioMG7CmctfR2Zj9Ong0XqvjUEtRvXvCmfDeo8GQRFSqb3LcoGlFHT6YcAg3JTgA843AporYJjazwNTjprxf6rAS1KyQgF-39dYJlnL4W4Kl5K_w_TeOduERMko7SmeBby0d8jw508iMG-FX6_h5rDy0G8y6ao_TpgmBriy4ljLhL3oJj6AF5QWBriW7BcE_tbUjCLPwFnBmp39Zy0xmD0AUBYjMPFuvoLuyY8qtFGNi-Bb4wizSiOBgL8Ut27q24vUb29ve-LB8nt-ZFJgXLWh8b68xDNaDAVqKGKdvy2', 'width': 3468}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['Photos are copyrighted by their owners'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6nM0fIlvFI4ctU-OJE_R3MIsgrLHC9OCYLGIT_awuBQLs-aR58dJhIGhqbfdNUrLgEiTbjIGIdNdlfhQsvXLXjdIi6_eoRkZWM6W-Ky24Lj4SrXBZSZ-QKNCUu9UJfrHIiijaUeUFu6wAjumZu1VTl1K0TfwC3WSbwSSjpd4Dgg1tjV8nyvF98szKtXUXq3H-uFvCxOsYqgT45dDO4NFm-OnPTQIwgWlY1_mwCaE6sp-gxpd1ZJ8xLqg2GO4xfezYIBQl-ZWP3Wt1rH5eWB92wzhID_Qz4G866tdK3K9crPUYPJ2zNbwd2R9HOeJYodb3SS6-MfcSGIV6t3XHnAf3GNycs6nA3eybdqt6-Of7j1r5sZzzSBx8R832-IFUh1Xtb0N8a1LD8xx0OO-L19weIE0fGCG3d9P9Ung-YmmWLklZVmzZKQM-68_Ipc3QV', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3072, 'html_attributions': ['Photos are copyrighted by their owners'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5_CSsNNH9e81RL-PB7INixKx3oC8g1viu8LVVX_ztHkzMX04t1u3Pt-VlVYbrqusn1CBOTTORtXzDLj-OMQmAJV2SiQGVPE1u-xJSwGwN26JSpivpFooZgdQOP7VtAcu7VTSygVjfinYJc7xMvC3x6cWalOLD06yVr8q9zkVznX7hRMmhwSQklQZeQuakVc5WI09kdUfv5tfFs1dA_B3nOOd9GKTK014rWz8CfxcLJ3AKTL3gGynuF3WJJQv1efb0-l_w6KEg3dnnlq3bQWlRHbBAUym7KHVJFdVXJKRX2I6B1331fXUFkl4Kx4EHYxXZAo5ZDzVTTRBlpMcS4aDtOdWMbJDQ1yPfxPZ5hSdtBOaELHe1SM7-BC4IuK9HNC35aT9lZGTTvW0GvbKz0IiXF8FLpFufRvjFIASz1HUZHbw', 'width': 4096}, {'height': 2260, 'html_attributions': ['Photos are copyrighted by their owners'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4zz9d5fZ6vWl7dOsRRVoDgNTxgZ5eEk-vXMIS7ATiqKMDx5navZp-LlyWKTBgepnJmGlS1dP_57pPogdPDSaYEOTXKuZQp_bGMJnW2nEkBLKoI9_iNAgDYZfV4P9yOGaxGAFVzFFAVeTOwweChRfLk1HrLLs3AyHWKSBt9mYwGHJDDgucd1Lhbybx5zl9BZ578hltMCZUS_04xYn8DJJ-MHD2VomGiAWfE4lE1zhQgtCg4zB9hbMlh6QSVRp1pZTiTsE7TwDaQ7E8uk0ium4OEudZiPgb8NwU4pvngeqKgST0cPvqfS9b0tqVnFM3VKfN9rDnaP4-LuMMUatbPhDpHEHEQsakq3-exDs8kdMm9U6-4QbRheVzxoBrbk3kXPGLybAHm9pv6aUC9CwSMf7Ny3SAkPC2NJxkbwHeR1qTfNtDV1PoprwQTN6lKWynn', 'width': 4019}]"
12,Scullery,"The pesto egg toast was absolutely delicious! A thick buttery slice of multigrain toast with a nicely cooked pesto egg on top was a hit. I had a seasonal lavender latte which was good, not too sweet with subtle hints of lavender. I felt a little overwhelmed dining inside by the amount of space proviThe food and coffee was absolutely amazing! We had avocado toast and PB&J toast, they were both put together with precision with fresh ingredients and homemade bread. The latte and cappuccino were also just perfect.

The staff were super friendly, and having fun while serving up greatness. The venueI recently visited this small cafe and was genuinely impressed by the warm and cozy atmosphere it offers. Despite its size, the space has a great vibe that makes you want to stay a while, perfect for a quiet break or catching up with a friend.

The staff were super friendly and helpful, which added If you don't want to pay for a big dining area but get some spot on breakfast this is your place. Some seats inside and chill music. Had the passion fruit and cream cheese Danish and Pesto and Egg. Was able to grab a Monster next door.Quaint little place for simple coffee and toast. The toast options are good with both vegan and regular options, and coffee definitely tastes better than what you get in the hotels. Was a large cuppa too when I had it for dine in.

13,Caffe Greco,"Accidentally stumbled into this cafe, while waiting for our pizzas to cook in a nearby restaurant. This cafe transport you back to the last century. The decor is very 1960s. The space itself is huge though and has plenty of seats. They also have an outdoor area which is nice on a sunny day. UnfortunStep back in time or even into a little town in Italy and get a bite here. We got the breakfast panini and coffee. It was fantastic. As you can tell, they take their coffee seriously! It was super busy and we had to wait a few for our food, but it was worth it. Highly recommend this gem in Tiny ItalReally enjoyed this café — the service was excellent and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. It’s the perfect spot to start the day with a good breakfast and a nice coffee.Nice to see people reading books and having a coffee. Cash only but no expectation of tipping. $26 for coffee, cake and sandwich. You get what you expect, it was a good experience.Great for working, relaxing, or people-watching.

15,The Coffee Berry SF,"Very cute lil spot. I can't speak on the beverages, my goal was the pastries ($6.50) 🤭 but they use Sight Glass beans, so I'm sure the coffee is fantastic.

The workers (owners?) will immediately make you feel welcome and valued. The drinks and food are delicious and dogs are welcome. You’ll find a lot of locals withWorthy of all the 5 stars. It is a small coffee shop right at the bottom of Lombard street. We really enjoyed our Nutella latte and lavender latte. The ube croissant was our favorite. The savory pull apart was ok. They have indoor seating for like 8 and a couple small tables outside.We had the savoury pull-apart bread and the twice-baked ube croissant and both were incredible. The pull-apart bread was moist throughout and super flavourful. The ube croissant was crispy, with creamy filling, and an amazing sweet crust.

I ordered a breakfast bagel and a cappuccino, and my wife had the salmon avocado toast with green tea. Everything was delicious — fresh, well-prepared, and beautifully served.

Matcha: tastes like grass and vegetables really did not like.

The bagel was toasted to perfection! 10/10 would recommend.Definitely a 5 stars for me! One of the best breakfast sandwiches we’ve had 👏😋 Loved the pork&turkey sausage in bagel and bacon cheese croissant. Mocha and caramel macchiato were mmm mmm mmm. The vendor was really friendly and accommodating. She suggested for a croissant bread for my mom so it will What a find!
It’s located right at the station, you’ll need to go down the escalator. They have a lot of options.
I got the bagel cheese avocado bacon with spicy mayo on the side. It was AMAZING!
So fresh, everything just felt like it was made on the spot.
Super tasty and full of flavors. I would deI don't often write a review, but the chibata breakfast sandwich (with pastrami rather than bacon) is absolutely magical. Will definitely have this again when I visit SF!Such a tasty breakfast sandwich in a cute setting (down the escalator). Atmosphere was great with the cable car turnaround right there and a local drummer playing good beats.

20,Alchemist Bar & Lounge,"A true Hidden jam in downtown San Francisco

This themed bar had everything that I could’ve ever hoped for! With a great selection of drink menus, I scurried in just after happy hour to sit down and enjoy quite a few drink drinks by the expert bartender Gerson

My waitress, Cindy took care of every Didn’t try the food on my visit so I cannot vouch for that. Great service & tasty cocktails. The atmosphere is quirky & reminded me of Tim Burton’s movies.good ambiance and date spot, however, slightly awkward crowd. music is alright and there’s weird (but slightly entertaining projections of things). interesting cocktails (actually quite overwhelming — I couldn’t pick), and “good bar bites.” decent service. over all a 6.4/10 and i may go again.Ok, so I’m the worst only only captured the bathroom, but I mean look at that nice detail!

Anyways, this place had been a favorite of mine for years. Great atmosphere and energy with locals and visitors. Drink rotations super fun and the service is great!

The drinks are very interesting and the atmosphere is quite unique. I had a great time. Of the two drinks I tried, I loved one (It Takes Two to Tango) and didn't care for the other (Neuromancer). However, I took a risk and tried something out of my comfort zone, so I can't fault the bar for it!

21,Smuggler's Cove,"I don’t understand what the 1-star reviews talking about. The service was amazing. After telling the barkeeper once my name he called me after my name. Our drinks were done under 10min. Very friendly stuff.
I can recommend to come before the rush like around 9pm. It’s easy to spent there 3-4h.Worth dropping by for a drink, although not really designed to hang out. Strong drinks and limited seating kind of make you feel like you’re intended to move along. Drinks were really tasty and aesthetically presented, and the line outside moved pretty quickly, so I’d go again if in town, but wouldnThis is an amazing part of tiki history, worth visiting at least once. The service was good. The drinks were solid, though leaned sweeter than I expected, especially the Zombie (not pictured). My favorite was the Rum Barrel. The presentation of the drinks was somewhat understated.

I think “tiki culSome of the best tiki vibes you can find at a tiki bar. Even has a 2 story water fall!
Drinks are top notch across the board.
You do have to order at the bar at this establishment. They’ll call your name when your drinks are ready. Many tiki bars I’ve been to in the past will have someone wait on yoSmugglers cove is the cutest tiki bar! Beautiful decor

What a drink menu, it’s so good! Many cocktails to choose from and the bartenders are phenomenal. The drinks here are an art form and the presentation was excellent

22,Pacific Cocktail Haven,"Stopped by on a Sunday night and it did not disappoint. The place was lively with great music and a fun crowd. The bartenders were friendly, the service was on point, and the drinks were creative and well-made. Definitely a solid spot if you're looking for a high-energy cocktail bar with a great vibCame on a Thursday evening and there was no wait. Our party of 4 had 3 drinks each, and they were all phenomenal! Standouts were the numb and number, silky street, and pornstar martini. Service was fast, and our server made great recommendations!PCH was on our list of bars to hit during this trip to the city. What a fantastic choice we made! ""T"", our bartender, was awesome. Engaging, super knowledgeable, and just a pleasure to talk to. Made the visit THAT more enjoyable!
Incredible craft cocktails here at Pacific Cocktail Haven! If you're iIf you're not on a budget, and enjoy unique cocktails, then this place is for you. Visiting from Seattle, this bar was recommended as a place to try in the downtown SF area. Going on a Tuesday evening, it was not busy at all. We stuck with the Whiskey section of the menu, trying the Tropical GangstaA must if you visit SF and enjoy cocktails.

They have a long list of drinks and everyone would find one that they would enjoy. It gets crowded, but we were able to find seats a little late into the night.

Definitely a younger vibe, but not a crazy crowd.","{'casualness': 0.6, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 1.0, 'elegance': 0.7, 'authenticity': 0.3}",0.9,"550 Sutter St, San Francisco, CA 94108, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103682043576342475439"">Yuen Tyrus</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5S0kLk-QHJ2zs3Lzr4UZW4fZovXNU0yqK1s64WNflALoTw_n-lIkkVHGvPMFgZ-hMvt7_eMc-YcOYxkEHNJMsDlgIfrJu9cCtkcJQX_4PLYK7g3nkwOt90TpYZRvzNEBIcINm8DIoCkTw9WoRA9IkxMwyGwBhczW_hWGlAmvEzj83w6SJqu0K7OZhtSLERgW-X842IB7fm0N7hLmOSjvVxQaoT9zZ8bFcWAaUGNlJtbqZs3BEENAZLMHFHOsUpuw0ObOJC0KAyY9TCU9hDp5zXILMb_bJXIVQMi17pNeVn70CyiYr0bvEarxhy678WQevLKLcpmvUPsdf4_qQjqNmONQ3_febK08cT23Ka-A-2F_bL_oTya8E0fwgIsdopKgrXhDJA8UX0tZxzNOSsRW5FU7RPPhDc83My_rBlG8CLLq81LK6Rc_RVMCjW7QJR', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106342829153197576753"">Barry Hashimoto</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6ZjMizga_uYi5MCRMHbLcgpjGFvFveWH_rRoPysR8J-xqKJY0tdSWt9n4EwiZs5j2rw8t3x7glOpsoGqpFkSVJcLifVZyVF1QjX69H5K_QTnJL-VR5IJ7YRHGAWcdrH_A_vSIMJI2_JSuMXkqRKP0KyL-oy1h6r9u9SPntH5LwMmHK7f-Vns5ILs8xaO4iB0_xATf93IHPZqubzbXTncmEfOaRg94YuNSb9iuwExFm-8Z3-ZP1SE3SdmEpmUI2fTqpGPTEE1_F1mbLZA_mA_8gwBRhVnl4qiL1RwRRaEmsWCpcCAbP36h4bR1qvwi26B_HAJ2T1h71YPPJ0L7ADs0-QxyK6i98Ug_qH4CSfHhcOSdNBvuJ9OSGntnEfTkUA9YEcNfCEpulv2XeKoVrwPYDGLvl7EvIoV5m76VC_wOAMHQGCr-GMkpDb-5ZyQ', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 2160, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117213280009513098366"">James</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5HoOuXGkOrqhdWMejSSKiLx_ITdlSauGT0eZhn8piDIi3s1oo7NmGwiWm57CI2uvdaiuISExypONDxeDv3R-slhwXTBbefQhVVN06sG_21wwssrfsG5XaDAMsagZfW7HQUNC55o6Uxtd0p-wGuca_ZHRCRrQJyekcg9jDrnX_6itU9TQmxE24CbNDcDH3Lk45sb2AfHosa7SYzWx_AtMXRl4E8Hzo4jEJ3VrTp7FS6FcfWNBDKfIt6Q-x9R2ESYgs1eHbJDc3YbPcOgZ6VnkOHqQV7qftUfMunkayuuR2dh_tjVsDG_OWazkQAsOuwapibficdp4oFi0AQVmADsqLy2TbikkvQfTZaWGvH5EQ03aSGNBfy99VhxSns2jpejiz5oodjW_VY7-lKxgQV0yQR6B3fyG5Vbi2ripRQfWqnmdK3', 'width': 3840}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110900912013684923072"">Kim Pham, Pharm.D.</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7x4STjFYIaut1YDmZPUAlqyp2TY745J9JLorPY5DOC5gNycreS3C15MmcCCrzcCoG7WSXh_taM5n0DVPMA06-3Yk-Z5UhHp6UBw-CK-MBEaFZ9StOkqrcXT_jb60Yc3gg19zE_qcjbf9VvC0fDfIJT12eg4A_RhkIdlp58oy-YrEQ4SHIOF5ptzOStO4DBnIIFSknCxIlIrkZ6pzSn1CWTw0ZSsZ5SZMi_CDPcT_5jZ65evkJqElomqktY-cKAPDJdw3TKf-gnvqYF5203DWNkTXkDgdkB2JB5NSSNtZd5l_euxRdsvV8tcUW2lfcLyWnQh3xMyGsI6YKImibKHWHnyK3S-Od47DwyEjiRABKoMo5himQ4Z_xWA8IgWWOsl7lxVq1Fg6Oa2skxy0O4XnO6yBD2Dbq5ethPBS-UezOmSq38dwMawilm1HQnM1yA', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/101064923513500132769"">Roshen</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5DCjp_-edCL6SGXGRM4MC0KQQ32a46ijgdh6-0fGvC2I7D3hSeN9nPsdSbT8j4IjnNBQPOhVO9cjs230MuHj1soIe-ae5trQKKAQS-14fOgkNIk83noOF94spZrRUJa7OJ-Tf-euklSe0tDKtnLkOK0tA5WQD45mM_vo-JtlTuotF54JwJr-gPbjRMSMBrHuNdCc1rVHt1YOEszOEfBkUoQiboMrCFNf5kx0KueUbw0WFUjqUlgYEsqijw0KP4ytDESOAqHdsKw5yWT0krUgpv2DpvrO2BSetVOID0GgMHnfWKrAxpQyQei89jrPWHvITKSOmT-z3h88PtZ4VlpdddBINCvDZ_mqVwl16ssZW4p08wNRNNdbLr_U7RR2t7UGQpzqN8SrdEeHfLBpRcMLjwbTK8aNWnCqt5KLjka-ppb9tHHiyxQi0taWiQTA', 'width': 3024}]"
23,Blackbird,"One of my favorite spots! Great happy hour and all the drinks are delicious. Friendly bartenders, quick service, good ambiance (lighting that’s moody but doesn’t make you feel like you need an eye exam), and plenty of seating. What’s not to love?This Bar is really nice .
Cocktails are good .
I ‘ m not drinking alcohol at moment and the bartender made me his favorite drink ,
a mohito without alcohol .
The bartender who helped me ,
I can tell that he love what he does.
Looking at him making drinks it could be almost hypnotic.
The perfect timiI wish I could say this bar felt like a safe, inclusive space, but my experience here the opposite. Blackbird may market itself as a gay-friendly bar, but that doesn’t prevent discrimination in other ways.

It was a Thursday evening, so it wasn’t very busy. The staff is friendly and the drinks are great.

The venue is gorgeous, the cocktails were absolutely top-notch, and the team took such great care of us from start to finish. Everything ran smoothly and effortlessly thanks to their profesI keep passing this very spacious place, which feels like a suit too large in which I may drown. But I am sure I can wear a snorkel to breathe in the air here, I can look around and choose my own ground here, and not be afraid that I can stay.
The lovely greeter is so immersed in the music, swirlingOne of the best places on earth to get the cocktail that meets any of your desires. See Boots cause he is the man !!!
Love this place yeeeaaaahWe came here for my wife's Christmas party. The band was fantastic. The atmosphere was incredible. The seat on the toilet needs to be fixed. Definitely a must see.This place is a vibe for sure and then it wasn’t….

We walked in and sat at the bar and our exceptionally talented barkeep mixed up a marmalade skies, and blackberry mule. We were not disappointed!! The flavors are phonemail and really delicious!

26,Cityscape,"I went there on a week day night. The bar wasn’t very crowded and it was open seating. I definitely felt like the view was a lot better than the one in the view lounge. There are a lot more seating that can see the view.
The waiter was super nice. He gave us good recommendation on the cocktails and Extremely beautiful views with delicious drink and (limited) food options. The service is great! Bartender Tommy was wonderful. He knows the area well, and is extremely helpful with travel tips. The atmosphere has a relaxed vibe. Highly recommend visiting right before sunset.After a full day of exploring the amazing city of San Francisco, we decided to end the evening with a relaxing drink at the Cityscape rooftop bar. Located high above the busy streets, it seemed like the perfect spot to enjoy a drink while taking in some stunning panoramic views of the city.

When weMy wife and I went here on a Tuesday night.

I ordered a Mont Gay Black Barell Rum and Coke. And my wife had a Coppola Director's Cut Red Wine. Both drinks were very good.

Beautiful view of San Francisco. Friendly servers. Relaxing atmosphere. We will definitely visit here again.This place was very cute! It had a gorgeous panoramic view of SF.

27,Local Edition,"No food here, but that's okay the cool underground jazz club feel was just what I needed for a late night escapade. The drinks were good and fairly priced. I would recommend you read all the funky news papers on the wall and take a closer look at all the type writers on the wall. 8.1/10Atmosphere was prime. Loved exactly what they had going on and the people I was with had a blast too! I wish there were snacks or appetizers to munch on. Otherwise, this is a nice place with a darn tasty cocktail menu!

Nice place for any occasion 💜We stumbled upon this spot late at night while on the hunt for a drink — and honestly, it was a vibe. A super cool underground bar with an intimate, low-lit atmosphere that instantly set the mood. It was definitely on the louder side (as expected), but that only added to the energy of the place. TheThis place isn't quite a speakeasy, but it does have the vibes of one. The reservations were a bit hard to get, so plan ahead. The live music was a massive boost to the ambiance.

Cocktails here are all about $16. They do a really cool fireI’ve never felt so disrespected in a bar before. The manager at Last Rites was rude, short, and completely uninviting. Their attitude made me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable, almost like I was not wanted there at all. It went beyond bad customer service and felt personal.

The main bartender was th10/10 atmosphere, 10/10 drinks, 2/10 service. Quite frankly, it’s a shame. The server never checked in with us once (we had to go up to the counter to close out) and gave my partner attitude when he simply asked for a straw. There are too many good bars in this city to return here.I cannot recommend this place enough. Second time here and it never disappoints. The drinks and place making are top notch, transformative, and set such a high bar for every other tiki bars in the world.Don't order a mixed drink here. I had only ONE - & got a splitting headache next day. What on Earth are they using for liquor here, rubbing alcohol? I can have 2 or 3 cocktails at home & feel great the next day.

29,Comstock Saloon,"Very unique place with a lot of history and some of the best craft cocktails I’ve ever had. The bartender took his time with each drink, making sure each was just right. With two drinks, you get a free light lunch on Fridays. It was corn chowder the day we went, which was phenomenal, but not hearty Stopped in for beverage and light bite. Great service, interesting history. Live music several nights a week. Local crowd mostly, typical old SF bar vibe. Great neighborhood hangout.Unbelievable cocktail joint with a vintage vibe and excellent staff. Oysters were great and served with a delicious minionette or an awesome smokey home make hot sauce.

I make a point to stop in here every time I'm in San Francisco if I can make an excuse to do so!A wonderful bar offering a variety of drinks and special cocktails.

1,Alla Vita,"Went here as a part of our wedding anniversary! Food was great overall, the vodka sauce and arancini’s were especially delicious. But what brought me to write this review was our service! We had asked to move tables because I wanted to be in the atmosphere of the main part of the restaurant and theyFrom the moment we arrived, the service was outstanding. Even though the restaurant only accepted reservations and the next available slot wasn’t until 9:45 p.m., we got there around 7:30 and the host went out of his way to help us. He offered us a table outside, and within 5 minutes we were seated Good atmosphere and ambiance. Very instagramy. The non alcoholic drinks were ok nothing to write home about there and very prohibitively expensive to be frank. The pastas were overall good. The fritto miso was tasty but lacking in quantity. The ricotta dumpling was by far the best and most unique. TCame to Chicago and celebrated my wife's birthday with a dinner here and I must say, it was one of the bast experiences we've had here. Everyone was very friendly and cordial. The ambiance was romantic but also fun. Words wouldn't do justice to the meal, but everything was great. A definite must if Alla Vita in Chicago has a beautiful atmosphere, and it’s definitely a visually impressive spot. We went for a dinner date and started with the Wood Fired Bread and Whipped Ricotta, which were both very good. For our entrées, we had the Tagliatelle, Rigatoni, and a side of broccolini.

2,Aba,"We went to Aba for brunch and it was such a great experience! They recommend at least 4 items for 2 people, and every dish we tried was excellent and absolutely mouthwatering. The Mediterranean cuisine with a California influence makes the flavors so fresh and unique. Both the outdoor patio and indoAlright y'all. This was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory. The moment you step inside this place, you know you're in for something great. Every single thing we ordered was delicious. We went for happy hour and tried the dip trio (hummus/feta/eggplant) and each one was amazing. Believe Aba is one of the best dining experiences I had in Chicago. The food was delicious. I have a nut allergy, and the staff did a wonderful job making sure each dish we ordered was nut-free. Very communicative. Prompt service. Beautiful ambiance. I have nothing but high praise for this establishment.Overall, Aba delivers the perfect mix of ambiance, creative drinks, and flavorful Mediterranean-inspired dishes. A must-visit if you’re looking for a stylish spot with amazing energy, great service.

3,Alinea,"Alinea was everything we’d hoped it would be, and so much more. Dramatic, unexpected, and fabulous from start to finish.

They make the experience everythiWow, our experience at Alinea was just awe-inspiring and hard to describe. My husband and I are lucky enough to have also been to the Inn at Little Washington and this was an entirely different experience. I booked seats in the Salon because the only seating for the Gallery (9pm) sold out instantly.This may be the most exciting meal I’ve ever eaten. It’s a place where spoilers should not be shared so I’ll withhold much of the experience, but Grant Achatz and his team delivers one of the most extraordinary dining experiences possibly anywhere on the planet. I was able to secure a seat at the GaWhat a unique experience. I went knowing almost nothing and I loved how I was constantly surprised by the creativity of the team in how they present the food, combine the flavors and and create a roller coaster experience.

I'm adding pictures to my review for myself, but I strongly recommend to avoAbsolutely phenomenal.
The entire staff was welcoming and fun. They all had a special flare that they added to each dish. Lots of surprises and whimsy!

6,Carnivale Chicago,"Beautifully designed, happy place full of flavor and lots of color!  It had been a few years since we’d visited and enjoyed each moment. The food was flavorful and portioned just appropriately for sharing. The drinks were fun and creative and the cotton candy/popcorn treat at the end was seasoned peFirst time at Carnival and really impressive restaurant. Great vibe and character. We were celebrating our anniversary and thought that this looked just right for dinner and drinks. Antonio our server was extremely friendly and took great care of us. It was a pleasure to have our table off the main I think they should bring new shoes in! Not sure what day they have the rope entrainment but that would be nice to see. The food was good and there is a lot to look at. The venue is huge. Service was good but a little on the slower side so if you need your check ask for it while they get you dessertAwesome place. So fun, colorful, and exciting coming here. Everything here is great, we got 2 different appetizers and 3 different entrees and there were 0 issues and everyone wants to come back! Our server was super helpful when we didn't know an ingredient. Would definitely recommend anyone to comWe visited after a LONG hiatus and finally had the whole family to share this place with. We saved for months to come here for our kiddo's fancy big girl birthday and she loved it. There happened to be Carnivale dancers every so often on the floor and it was incredible.

7,The Whale,"Our experience at The Whale in Chicago was absolutely amazing! The lobster and waffles were seasoned to pure perfection! Every bite was full of flavor and cooked just right.

The portions are generous, and the flavors are on point whether you’re there for brunch, dinner, or just drinks. The cocktails are a highlight, and the staff keeps things friendly and relaxed. It’s a fun placeI recently had the chance to visit The Whale and finally see what it’s all about. For the longest time, I’d driven past but never had the opportunity to stop by—I’m so glad I did this time!

We came for my cousin’s birthday brunch, and she had a fantastic time. My chicken sandwich was delicious, theDecided to dine in last minute for a party of 3 and a half (my infant). We ordered drinks first, which were part of happy hour (5-7pm). The cherry mule was my favorite, very refreshing and I also ordered the whale g & t that was more of a pine taste to it which I didn’t mind. For food, we ordered a I’m sold on this place based in aesthetics, but not all the dishes are meeting standards. We had reservations before hand. Parking can be a bit crazy.

We came at a different time, and the service was absolutely stellar even in a packed restaurant. The wine selection isGreat high quality Italian that features small plates. Recommend the Kale Salad, Beet Salad or Assortment of Olives to start. For entrees recommend the Salmon or Beef Short Rib - was tender and flavorful. Truffle Risotto was amazing, Shrimp Risotto is good too. They have a solid Gluten Free menu.Great Italian restaurant serving up “tapas” like Italian dishes. The pasta is delicious, perfectly chewy in sauces that are not overpowering. Service is good even during very busy hours and this place seems to always be busy in the evenings regardless of the day of week. There is seating inside (botI recently visited this Italian spot and was pleasantly surprised by how warm and lively the evening turned out. The pasta dishes were well-balanced, with fresh flavors and good texture, though I wished for a little more seasoning in one of the sauces. The staff were friendly and efficient, explainiThis place is ALWAYS busy, a popular corner in River North.

The Great place in Chicago to try authentic Kazakh cuisine! This upscale coffee shop has great food options and unique drinks to try.

The coffee options are vast and I ended up getting 2 drThis place is super cute. The food is relishes and they have a lot to choose from.

We ordered the Ironman scramblThis place is ideally located for the intense foot traffic for practically all days when it is open.  The place was packed on this sunny Saturday as autumn descends on the month.  This is a well established institution city-wide with many locations as a baker and grocer.

I really enjoyed their ham I went here on a Thursday at 8:30 AM. The café was very busy and they don’t have very good line management. People are always asking if you are in line to order or if you are waiting for your food. I think another issue is that the menu in the morning is way too broad and has too many menu items. MoGreat place for breakfast in the Downtown of Chicago. Just perfect if you have an early flight in and planning to explore the Art Institute of Chicago, which sits just a few blocks away.

Loved their house mocha they do called the High Five Mocha, it is this gorgeous complex chocolate with fresh grated orange zest. Cool multi use space. Good vibes.Such an amazing vibe of a coffee shop. Drink divine. Atmosphere amazing. Food bomb. A deadly combination. 1st time visit and it was unforgettable. Such a chill vibe to grab a coffee and chill.

16,Hexe Coffee Co.,"My wife and I love this place. We walk over all the time.

Hexe has a great, big patio which is perfect for nice days. The coffee is always good, and they have a solid food selection too. It's cool that they also offer alcoholic drinks and have fun events like trivia.

Plus, they always have water bI’m used to cafes back from home in NYC, so I wanted to find a place in Chicago to chill while I was staying here—Hexe is exactly what I was looking for.

The dirty chai latte I got was great—not at all cloyingly sweet like some places do, just a great blend of bitter and spice with a hint of sweetnThis is way more than a coffee shop!! 1st the vibe is amazing, & staff is sweet, and on it. You can see them recognizing regulars (love that in a local place) & have a pastry (delicious). Bring your pup, their outdoor space is lovely & they have a cooler of water to self serve you pup.

Best of all, you’ll never need to compete for outlets plug points line each wall, making it easy to keep your deviI really enjoyed coming here early in the morning, sipping a simple black coffee and sitting on their outdoor patio.

17,Gold Coast Cafe,"Great space, family friendly and amazing choices of sweet treats, kunafa, chocolates and more. I loved the iced Dubai chocolate latte especially!
Update: the Dubai chocolate croissant is divine! Also their kunafa is world class.
Appreciate their partnership with Kareem’s Sweets to incorporate more mI saw all the hype on social media and had to come check it out for myself. Coming here today made my day, the Philly was phenomenal and the meat and spinach pies were to die for. The people here were so kind and told me all about the vision for the future, pop up events, and the new location comingWalked in right when they opened. I didn’t catch the guy behind the counters name but was so kind in offering me different coffee options and walked me through the menu. Their coffee is amazing.

Coffee was so good I didn’t even make it down the block before it was almost gone. Can’t wait to go backHonestly this coffee shop is average (for the vibes), I have no idea about the foods because I only ordered a cup of ice coffee (americano).
I gave 4-5 ⭐️ because of one thing, that's port charger everywhere. My phone battery is dying and I am a visitor, use uber, so my phone battery is most importaHere you can find the best sandwiches! Fresh, full of flavor and very tasty!
I highly recommend this place if you want something fast and delicious to go!
I had philly steak sandwiches and was fantastic!
The owner of this place Hani is very friendly and kind!

18,Cold Moon Cafe,"Disappointed in my experience here. The food tasted fine but not closely worth $30+ for 2 bagel sandwiches. They don't have their prices listed on the giant board behind the counter and now I see why. The service was also really slow. We waited about 20 minutes for them to be ready. It is a one persIt was fresh and clean. My cashier was pleasant and very helpful. I recommend,
If I could make a suggestion it would be nice to have a bell so the attendant will be alerted when someone is waiting to be served.The wait was ridiculous!! They had trouble understanding my simple order. Would not recommend. Spend your time somewhere else!! The croissant wait hard as hell!! 0/10!!!!!Everything was great ! The Tasha’s secret bagel sandwich is the best I have ever tasted in my life. The smoothies were amazing and the service was phenomenal! Thank you all for everything !

I was met by great service from Ollie, who recommended the drink Daquiri 4-Way which was SO delicious! The Parallelogram is a close second. The prices are amazing Really great drinks for a decent price. The service here is also amazing! I got the queenie (pictures) salt creation, and the parallelogram. All of the drinks were delicious.

They have a great variety of cocktails 🍹- we had their boulebardier and I personally wanted something that was not sweet and asked for a Tequila Martini 🍸 and it did not disappoint. I asked for “La Gritona” Visiting town for a wedding and was looking for good cocktails, found this bar on Google Maps and it did NOT disappoint! I really liked the lowkey vibe and eclectic music selection. I ordered a pisco sour, then another pisco sour because it was so tasty! And very reasonably priced. The staff is realSuper cool place with great cocktails. Get a gimlet with a powder sugar rum, delicious 😋 the place stands true to its name, not much bigger than a matchbox.Stumbled upon The Matchbox the other night, and man, this place is tiny but oozing with that classic Chicago charm. It's like squeezing into a CTA train during rush hour, but way more fun. The bartender, Zack, whipped up a killer margarita for around $12—totally worth it. The vibe's cozy, making it If you love dogs go to this bar! I had just lost mine so Nadia put me on the corner next to a bowl of treats... Couldn't have been thirty seconds later three pomeranians are sitting at the door. That continued thru out the night.  Needless to say I didn't leave, and my soul was restored that night.

28,Gus' Sip & Dip,"Landed in Chicago last night and came to Gus Sip & Dip bc of a recommendation of a friend- this place delivered beyond my expectations. $12 for ea perfectly curated & beautiful cocktail- fries are so good you can't believe they're just handcut fries, Wagyu Sandwich & the cheeseDog!

Service was top Well done Lettuce!! Gus’ Sip & Dip is Chicago’s new gem. The atmosphere is incredible and the food, the food is even better.

Continuing a tradition borrowed from McSorley’s in NYC, you get a choice of light or dark beer, for which you receive 2 beer mugs per order.

We ordered the French Wagyu Dip The Breakfast Martini was hands down my favorite, tasty and the little toast on top was a nice touch. The gin gimlet was light and refreshing, and the espresso martini was smooth and not too sweet, perfect pick-me-up. We also had the warm olives with parm, which made for a great snack, and the friesThis place is the best new addition in river north! $12 well crafted cocktails $6 happy cocktails.my favorite is the clover club! We loved the black truffle grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque soup and we absolutely loved the roasted chicken dip sandwich.

29,The Meadowlark,"After entering the unassuming side door to Meadowlark we were greeted by a very friendly hostess. We were actually there to buy a gift card but decided to stay and check it out. The waiting area is separated from the main room and is quite small. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. We loved theMeadowlark Bar is such a creative and memorable spot in Chicago! The drink menu is wild—in the best way. Each page is themed around school life, and the cocktail ingredients play right into that concept. Super unique and well thought out. I tried some bar bites too, and they were just as inventive—eBeautiful place to experiment with drinks at. Chrissy (The Bartender) was extremely friendly. There needs to be a more clear understanding with reservations. I was told when it is a party of 2, reservations were not taken and that it was first come first serve. However 2 specific locations in the baMe and my hubby's all time favorite bar in Chicago! Every time we're in the city, we always stop by Meadowlark. We've had the privilege of trying three of their menus since their opening in 2023. They change up their menu every 8-12 months so you are getting a different set of curated craft cocktailI can see why Meadowlark made it to the top 50 bars in North America. Not sure if the theme continually changes bc the menu I had was different from the one on their website, but when I went recently it was space-themed. The cocktails were creative and spirit-forward.

0,Bottega Louie,"Went for Sunday brunch and had a delicious meal. We ordered matcha latte, green juice, Belgian waffles, açaí bowl, farmers market breakfast, salmon & bagel, and beignets. All were delicious. We also got several macarons, a baguette and pretzel from the bakery. Delicious! I would recommend. Large ligWe stopped at Bottega Louie, just a short 4-minute drive from the Crypto.com Arena, and had a really enjoyable meal.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, which came with a breaded chicken breast topped with their house-made marinara, Grana Padano, mozzarella, fresh basil, Espelette pepper, and a drizzleThe bite-sized macarons were displayed by color, making me want to try every flavor. I ordered chocolate, strawberry, pistachio, and vanilla, and I loved how the flavors were rich yet clean. The raspberry cream doughnut was also delicious; it wasn't too sweet, and the cream filling was perfectly balThe restaurant is combine with bakery. The service was good. They came to check from time to time.

They served bread before foods. And I’d ordered gnocchi and it was delicious!

Only pity that the restaurant has strong echo noisy environment. Everything became loud.I haven’t had a bad experience yet. And I can’t say the food isn’t delicious. It’s actually quite solid. It’s not the best food I ever had but it’s also very consistent and the portions are fair. You’re coming here for the atmosphere. Big, bright, loud, chic and the options are plenty.

1,Holbox,"Came here with a friend for lunch on Friday and this place totally deserves its Michelin star. We got there about 15 minutes before opening, so parking was easy and we were part of the first group in line.

Holbox serves Yucatán-style seafood tacos, and every single one we tried was incredible. We oI had huge expectation for Michelle 1 star. Long story short, it is not worth to wait 1 hour to get the food. I might try again if no line.
The octopus was good but not exceptional, the sauce was not aligned with octopus and not tasty.
The Aguachille was too sour and couldn't enjoy it well. Octopus Amazing very high quality seafood taco options at an affordable price. The Baja fish tacos were so crispy and so tasty, my wife loved it, we had to order a second round! The Baja shrimp tacos were also great and a good size compared to any shrimp tacos I ever had. The octopus tacos were cooked just Phenomenal food! Exceptional, creative, and incredibly delicious. I was first skeptical due to the long wait outside, but when you get in and are seated, the food order and delivery is fairly quick. Prices are absolutely reasonable for the quality.

2,Girl & the Goat Los Angeles,"Might be a 20/10 now. Had maybe my best meal ever before and was scared I may be let down this time and can say without any hesitation I was not at all and loved every bit of it once again! Definitely my favorite restaurant ever! Group of 4 of us went and ordered the naan, kimchi sourdough, spicy haWe had such a great dining experience. The ambience was nice, the service was great and the food delicious! There was not one dish that we didn’t enjoy. We started off with grilled oysters and kimchi bread as appetizers but they went over a complementary naan for the long wait. All three were soooo Came here early with a reservation and our party of three was immediately seated. My only note about staff is they're always at the ready to bus the table which might give some diners a bit of anxiety. Other than that, they're very friendly and responsive.

We ordered the kim chi sourdough, spicy haBeautifully creative flavors and fresh takes on familiar foods. Really enjoyed the surprises we experienced with the food pairings. Portions are designed to share. Heirloom Tomato dish was my fave!  Bright, airy dining room with relatively friendly staff. Very homogenous clientele/staff that were noI brought my hubby here for his birthday. It was a very good experience. The food was solid. Drinks were also solid.

There wasn't anything that really blew us away. When we asked if one dish was spicy, the waiter said no, but to us it was.

3,Redbird,"Great vibe, nice hospitality, can’t beat the setting. The food was good but not out-of-this-world good. Our favorite part was actually the free bread to start the meal. We weren’t told what it was but it was stuffed with a light cheese? and it was amazing. The crudo was fine but nothing unique. The As we acclimate to being parents and finding places that we can pop in and still have a good time with our baby, Redbird raised the bar.

We were able to walk in firstly get to order from the happy hour menu which does come with the requirement of being seated inside in their lounge area but it in iThe atmosphere is chill but distinctly upscale.  The inside seating has a fancy lounge vibe to it. We sat outside with the open air ceiling and it was very pleasant. The menu was not overwhelming but still had some nice options. The food was delicious. The drinks were on point. Great spot for a niceWe came here on the day the LA protests were happening. So things would have been quieter i am sure.

I highly recommend the prawns which were full of flavor. The snap peas were so refreshing and delightful.

I really liked the Cavatelli because it wasn't too heavy. The pork chop was prepared very wBeautiful restaurant, with pretty bathrooms.
Food quality is superb. Had the sea bass, smoked tofu and fig appetizer & mochi nut dessert.

Cocktails are very unique with fruity wine mix and carbonation.

4,Maccheroni Republic,"I didn’t want to be generic and order what everybody else did. However, I did. Hahaha. I ordered Bianchi and Neri, and it was delicious! No wonder it is a popular dish. Pasta is cooked just right. Not too thin or thick. Sauce is creamy. Delicious. I added cheese on top, but I probably didn’t need itI thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at the Maccheroni Republic.  I appreciate all of the trees and greenery within the concrete jungle of downtown LA.
I ate the delicious salmon spaghetti with lemon and capers.  The service was quick and I witnessed many tasty dishes being served to tables of locals and tPastas on point! No reservations unfortunately so recommend going on an “off time” such as a weekday evening. We went on a Monday and didn’t have to wait. They have wines and cocktails available but you can bring your own wine for a $30 corkage fee. The pastas are the highlight here so definitely reI picked this restaurant for our group before the Pink Marrini concert tonight. Didn't know them before hands, just googled and couldn't wait to experience...

Cocktails: very creative with different mixes and very good. We had Passione and Watermelon Ciao. Very refreshing for a warm summer night.

It’s rare to find a restaurant where the food, service, and atmosphere are all equally on point. Stepping into this oasis downtown feels like walking into a trattoria in Italy — such a treat. We’ll definitely be back the next time we’re in LA.

6,Manuela,"Loved this restaurant including the vibe. Impressed with the albacore spread served with a bold rice cracker that was so large , you broke off a piece at a time and spread the delicious tuna. Outstanding! Also the little neck clams in a rich broth served with delicious toast. I never wanted this to Fresh green plants everywhere, ample seating, great lighting and wonderful, knowledgeable plus friendly service. And the food is delicious. I would watch out for those delicious, buttery, flakey, rich, heavenly, satisfying house made biscuits with the side of honey butter!Manuela is a gem of restaurants. The atmosphere is like a peaceful garden, inviting you to sit & enjoy. The service was top notch, everyone made us feel welcome. All the food recommendations were perfect. We could not have ask for anything better. I'm excited to return for  their brunch. This is a mOne of my favorite neighborhood restaurants.  The bar staff is attentive and friendly.  Shout-out to Ray for making sure I was comfortable ( using my non dominant hand) I  love and hate that the wine list changes so often.Manuela is truly a gem in the heart of the Arts District — a perfect blend of unique atmosphere, creative energy, and unforgettable flavors. From the moment you step inside, you’re immersed in a vibrant yet relaxed vibe that perfectly captures the spirit of downtown LA.

7,Bestia,"Great experience, wonderful food.  The standouts were definitely the scallop crudo and the lamb neck.  Sauce on the gnocchi could’ve been a bit more flavorful and the pluot crostada needed a bit more fruit for the amount of crust but really we’re nitpicking here.  Service was lovely.Absolutely obsessed with Bestia. The flavors, the sauces, the creativity…everything was on another level. Every dish felt perfectly balanced and memorable. We had the endive salad, bone marrow, grilled octopus, fig leaf ricotta tortellini, and the black ink spaghetti. Each one was a standout in its By far the best and liveliest atmosphere of any restaurant we visited on the west coast.

The roasted bone marrow with the mini spinach gnocchetti is out of this world.

Highly recommend bestia for the food and atmosphere as ALL the dishes were amazing.Perfect dining experience! Wonderful service, volume in restaurant was great (no problem hearing each other) and food was a work of art. We loved everything - scallop crudo, burrata cheese and tomato salad (so fresh!), sage pizza, and lamb sauce tortellini. We loved everything!! It was beautiful andPlace is really loud so it's a bit difficult to catch up.

Burrata tomato salad - 3.75 stars

Branzino - 4 stars
Good crisp skin, tender flesh.

Corn agnolotti pasta - 3.75 stars
Texture is great and I liked the corn filling (like a corn soup) but the filling was on the sweet side.

8,Chi Spacca,"I went to Osteria Mozza (which I really enjoyed) and thought Chi Spacca would be on the same level given the reputation—but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.

I left genuinely disappointed by both the food and the service. The waitress was inattentive, bordering on rude. We were ignored multiple Chi Spacca will always hold a special place in my heart—my now fiancé took me here for dinner right after he proposed! From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm, intimate, and welcoming. Our server was absolutely amazing—attentive, kind, and genuinely happy for us, which made the eveningAmazing high quality steak house.   Came here for my birthday and got the porterhouse.  Was cooked exactly how I like it and it was massive.  My favorite part is to eat the bone and while I was doing it the chef came up and said it was such a compliment to see me eat the bone cause so many don’t.  RI have to come here at least once a year, its just so perfect! Everything on the menu is perfect even the warm Dates are perfect I had the tomahawk pork chop this time unfortunately I was so stuffed from eating  everything else on the menu first that I hit the wall after about three anazing pieces. Exceptional. I travel and dine constantly…this is the best food and dining experience I’ve had in 2024. Full stop. Can I say exceptional again? Everything we had was delicious and differentiated.

It was delicious and definitely big enough for two to share. The syrup was good and not sickly sweet. Also had the Maine lobster omelette which was to die for.

Decorative delicious cup of coffee are just some things I enjoyed!My girls said it’s “MUST-GO” place in La.
We ended up going there two consecutive days! So many menu options and great food.
We loved pizza, matcha latte, green smoothie, cheese danish and croissant donut.
We came back with my friends and had a wonderful time here.

Line is long but they move fast aLoved the coffee! Low-acid and hand-selected, so I grabbed a couple of pounds to go. The atmosphere feels authentic, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and the staff is very welcoming. Also picked up a pecan pie and a pumpkin pie—both were delicious! I’m usually not a fan of pumpkin pie, butLong time diner here, first time leaving a review. The aloha blended drink is so good, I had to give you a 5 star review. If you ever remove this drink from the menu, I I swear will come back and give you a 1 star review.

14,Alchemist Coffee Project,"I love this coffee shop! The coffee is excellent — this was my second visit, and it was just as good as the first. If you ever find yourself in Welshell, definitely stop by this place. Highly recommend their coffee!Was staying in the area for a couple of days and we were able to walk to this cute little shop. Fun decorations inside very like steampunk in a way but for coffee.

Service was goods

My friends enjoy their coffees, so I’m not sure what they were drinking, I think they got the same the next day .

TIntended to pay a visit to their West Adams location, but apparently the listing was kinda misleading as it's not open yet. Having 2 existing locations in Ktown, the one at Pearl apartment was just awesome and I couldn't agree more when plenty other reviews called it as productive space. Yeah, just I discovered this café by chance while walking around Los Angeles. The service is quick and very friendly. I spent some time there with my wife, she had an almond milk cappuccino, and I had an iced hibiscus tea.Been here twice so far and both times have been great.

The available syrups are not house-made, so I skipped on getting vanilla latte (my go-to drink) and got the Spanish coffee, which was great. Their Matcha latte was pretty solid too.

Btw, I loved their Basque cheesecake. It was delicious.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.4, 'authenticity': 0.1}",0.9,"698 S Vermont Ave Ste 103, Los Angeles, CA 90005, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 1035, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100013179137840352125"">Alchemist Coffee Project</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7VdXpng7ubT4QHGZ5T4XUd5flKNbH7oNfam0gJGHh4DMEVYLpT_QZlUPloCyIGNf4uRwGWZHf-uWNyuEpBc71rafu9AwAWhENLGNDiyb8hv5uhT6268gI1lrN2vaw84klYDnZW6aTRht7bRwhXpFZuiVz9UQtpj9KKv535ioi8wT7iREfai7zbBmoLatBXfymYzB2KpmiZ-v7ucTc8izU56VmA-NOtjbkj7mYwrL2rfbFyXoVndJr6Pgp2YZ0HJTTEFM-EemKRjp7eoyXCfFx3hYp8R-lu84tQOC0peeAMwg', 'width': 3039}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/101324872460183185965"">Mr. Tustin - Mauricio Roque</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4SHcXgQ9LWQgjcZsxLrGIFeC5Z-2xU9-ksSCFzCZlDcI4J2q-s4xqxpJN2T_QlVcbn08qFlV40bLBOt_7x_99wTXLkD5EHQlgx1DjKRi5qcdcO7LzMA92NPrnwEKzpRuxBFzHI4XoLAq0u57ub9zYrFHhd3zwOZitnhEGwd7YqyWcm4zaysH_v8yj_uBl1U7CbmDZKAQ8hF_vwqTIhXURg8Qcag7Eo8WgprMFtTl_9W80njk52bheQ2gT4gOIwshflzysAi2WuEmLwxR50fQfip6_h0S60pLGfUCvX9E8egpZfIdlHbskfTgEJq45bvsTW3aMB52WrXcS3sKYdPFxQy0gfEUZwnON6sb1e-ym2HT8uWA3eoA3efDzyfibIBczoOe0XybGZsHBLmCZiOP5Exhuht7NDQA6vkz5KRUs', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107454730067131261554"">Christopher Vargas</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU77bw3vccJ6ziZj1EMSqvZE5h2ERKgdd9atk3HQU2nvMjSq_EGOLUYd_aXysm6dTNsyg3uh2vUNNAE8zFpTacJGW031FD5HKQ0KAaanukXcBmu1tFjYQFilAzrB5mQthJv89EartURZGrfgBGYwgXMQRaXf9n68qM-acoboBEHHsQksO86-T-Jyga31TPMdtvjbY3Ss0BG5Ebj1fUx_8pvFowc1_gkHYilCuwa48w5jTk8ln5cg-cZ4P9I6_rB5NKZwGa0YOhB_umpH0IGmCUURdwk-60vi4pnGclCBZaMFDf1prvn9WCMmx4KhyjkK2-4AdbRDtJpfqjNnGlEyV9PtyytN2Vtlz4prm29b7d9T_FhJ3kWm2Jlr6CdfMuT3YdlHYhXlS6UDc8VzVC_4zXr7jWsODgDwT0RoQgBUlQVHcjFC', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112488380768496494605"">John Ogalesco</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4pZUV6_09EMM5oz3wrhpfNTjgXna05q5RLjUkI-Esu0BYlisEgdjjjGmT09Da_0x2iGcKYBwY1CxO9t-mmP5_P5ckGmy_vVMTrs2gtns_ss9XXFqDZ4t_R2WEKsYjtBWyHD9R4l5wA2Xr9mvZE9exLTkoWwLol90BZOZeFKiJ_AYxavNjY7kFNvpA4xA22TaYpv2dhv4GXDanQqe7ieSrt5sZsm2Nn-MwiIE12Rx5zaKDuce3QKomt70N69BMJIlu-mCJ5XDhPURg1sbZLDAYM7-KtTH0jubpgh_QNE6_DENB-ss_aN_SzDEBe1gEXOelH3OnfFfJAZdWKusEzt9GxN5Z08EW4HZqM_wfaTp9OzHIEjVBDWDiNATo7eorn0fzg4CA2hruAA_FOztVx_kso-WtUTBjqemlyV_07aZPfnw', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113881877358712770024"">Israel My Hope</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4x2deEfpVQ6FsdE-GuGHrAj8hoTNiXOQ_Iakz3MpFaRQ8HFz9rryYZXi_fRuc6s-gIsJ9JOXFrHWlvoV0ysxPX93QoWzinwa7cP4w1eexDR3sHFLrZjLkTSmN-SyfdIvh6xykbJf9iQ9Xf0B6x5aTB0bP5AWvwpkbvIdFuM4J7oNYyris1TKVaBkUfGPkLcta5nONZNi47MXN7XPBtFS31F-X7K9RjM0STAWyWAkqlaNuyyR2MDNH9_hSKFZ9tBCuk0LW3guzwZqdydRH-s92npIhtfjhw5jmekfGldyprIzJM7nqur7m3kHJKE518_pLK3DgUSLg3OfhwhYg4-eUDT-nsvgZXtlNpDisTPJhH4EDWKstaJyqaI42Nm1IOthqRKUgSZuJKWJpwt6tl-kVT1IKqhrfNXHK4_QDg4KHMXdiugjxkBUshDZsBUw', 'width': 4000}]"

THANK U GUYSIf you're in the vicinity or staying at the Hollywood Hotel, visit this venue for for hot or cold lattes and teas. Coffee is a special bean from Mexico and each is made with care and ❤️ from the owner. Maria is upbeat, efficient, courteous and cares about the customer.  Don't leave without somethingThis coffee shop was near our hotel so we stop there for breakfast, and it is a decision I do not regret at all !!!
The food was excellent. I took a breakfast sandwich.
The coffee is to die for !!!
And the atmosphere the cherry on top of the cakeThis Latina woman–owned coffee shop is such a hidden gem. From the outside it might look a little rough, but step inside and you’ll be greeted with the warmest service and the most delicious food. I had the best breakfast sandwich I’ve had in a long time, and the mazapán latte was out of this world.A very cute small coffee place. We were coming down from a hike and needed some coffee. We saw this and stopped by. I also got a breakfast bagel really good. Will come back to try more coffee drinks for sure.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 1.0, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.5, 'authenticity': 0.9}",0.95,"1144 N Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90029, USA",,5,"[{'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115586690755769467260"">debbie</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5TiJJELK40a7N1hi_aRSyWvG3JuC6QuT9c6kk-GNuNFg61Gk3Yfd6vqXBqz1qPB14rFKZ3DzN2jpccoY5gL5zJHxMafpnFGoHRPzP23BtjSA70Q1I0u5T_4oVBx1teNa69YXkV8cNfD22BV8ASYC5nB3jfF06Q9604mnFHxVgiINFzkVqbKqlBo2dN7ssvqw-1y0J9dZ6_bcJtnf2PswWTaxNibeg3JVJELjUg72MA8HKFVIvug2_txcYngtUobJ_bdJu7KDEPp2R0NRO4Gm4AGsWhxb9j2PQn8hXEXcREaZ_BUvblreXkUmO4_aI9-eP-CXNmg2xGNTDtyPaUgxokfF6rC4zIWo_aH-FtK7KoBfTVrTtcDC3nN2jg9STJKK9200AMwg4g98Vx5jBy_-ONM-TLOavkySoihi6FUo_PYDlxMAAOMDOVH2rozQ', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/101251823711896735730"">Lauren Oliver</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6NSYGyA4mTyVC2Pb-Utsobq7f62juRVEo6Kac6BHPGcHyMZ03bg1FjGoXButaXpRpFhyVtrEi9kOhGkteBaiRITrigk6i7raoVH5KwhgOL0IQFeOI1ZC94DrcZ5qfdRkidLsKgI7OF9lrsGHUaCcoz_nt0l3XyKZEXLBsMqwSuK9XTV43mRxxNNKcy9myZSj6iokjeJyYnVDAyhaEhpyDUr2DZ0KmU-cTjgv8Q_9WDWijevAdWqj46oCbj_fdmhqj1F94lTBv14SED-Hp03WLdkeS09Ecx3ZDnl_tZUXH9q7uKITaos0KOVGPcs0yT41-P4yiW9MBHu8EBPC_-rrkPG4L_6vSNp8uDpVbWUs2ofOjkzlNvTdkKVIQ7b09Fiavlx8Z0A04JWY_OaT_BAbfTfcvl0q3l7E-XCaCRmf5grhuzgWjCbZKNDBrfoWyh', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/108101283676250067530"">Harvey (harvey)</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6NefcKAHB1Rft5ba8CG-BuIDhAB1FeUJEgNpUWC2FlabhnVIwjfonp-e15X0WDaDqYJimO9P1KbMTyGFvot_2smZnw4SLkn9ajAWEfdHubEvEhxGsmu54DwP9x3XXYIRs-coBMzoDk7eMifidwGIBpzij4LwKPODpuDk0Ldkjy3kZUsLx2tsPTh4ySXBG7Ugof-XJ9QaeCpSwxIxGR0G0Om-bmBH2C9oJgo2dlXqputf4nIHNdcfxGhoq-BBmflBvQ6lYmoeAbjgx56C_9LBTpe3yVJdb99QsHTf5lonXlvEAC64pAnEUrgXDi1xuSCSLKtTXDL6xhaEh5ZrgLNBGVzrK0tYvsnKoOuZrFgV2HpLeFebajXp-wN-yRp5usCFXBV1_f0f809iphbP_PGagAyMORTyZt2EDMx3o3vs0jOXVFPHiVCICPf4r4I-H4', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115586690755769467260"">debbie</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5GNVSgkm7L6_XsUXikdFe1VvsjT6-5fNnnqUGyunLThmv6CT30wjCu1QCJ2svEh7h8X4Mb7Ji766DcQpNjmyZTlg0ttC-ZnMAn_UFLB1g8kY31I62-jT8kxE21MoGiaGZiT-BYxFYwkpM78qnZRHHG-Af8lIt0URwFE1VMaQ56nWsj4oIZxV5S-JzS9o2BBVFc6x3iNbbrGIRtVk40_M7vbh_Zn53z9My86fC91y-gTLEJS3i_o1IMe5D_v9g9_u-qoQ9IgsjdrURwKyXqA04V5xJQkHBgL98Gsg3hdZ1-_hmpiyS8ykFB4UAyS7jXYOMdyumiEl9Yv114mLJJtrg6d4qzkXFBdQbi3K0gYlQZvk9MvyogbEwGLd14UTpFcyAY34pVSm7ZLI-DYT2E4XQIZDXzbvVq3Xd_RsSkU3ufERiO1KpVvsp5K68YQQ', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103007714633583501422"">Raziel R.</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6raJtTxZDzOpVpt19nhrTybJazpXDQJUpS6a5L-IxcOhzDcXcKwkGG7v_m7AHXK7w1ExGxW8tru_l2mWtMiuS__DXeSwm8xcy0fccnqUDUb59beOtevOrwcYXeSJLseOiy6gp-B0btedkOQjPkLw2t2dNDY1HhmGfPw0ZUmHxL1pH5xrLzEViy6a4tmuUbzq3VP-0r9wM2vBVb-9g8Hz1MDqCLZtEY0gykI3skur0yK5NpdOknn8V_4c8iEzOO_2mqhWUOvs7rp-CBBrg3M4kvpbyGPYAPzzZ441v0w7hzgR17YfYwC5LyTBbUITZBX9Rp9iUMb9iXfMlPajhfvzhhC0Y7QXCJ1IdXqPpYQOIFM3Kmg446Pn5vJUGL-Ir4RdN9szhadIZUS1BXUCcRHQgRosbt7j2GPOkkwDg4xdVJxsPBnuUDl0V0pyVuhg', 'width': 3600}]"
16,Yeems Coffee,"the coffee at yeems is always a hit— super strong, high quality flavor with minimal wait time and fuss. their set up is extremely direct and no nonsense. very limited seating inside and parking can be fairly difficult in the tiny lot they’re in but the coffee and matcha are completely worth it. i reLovedddd the drinks here, I got the passion fruit drink they had and even though I’m not a huge fan of passion fruit it was delicious!!! I also tried a friends strawberry matcha and it was also great! The service was very fast and the girl that took our order was so nice!You smell Delicious coffee from the parking lot. Vienna latte is amazing. Holidays hours posted. Among all great cafes, I keep coming back here before I leave LA. Both hot and ice coffee are good.This shop has limited parking, and it charges a fee, so you need to find a spot on the street, which can be difficult to find. The coffee is good. I tried their Top 1 coffee, which is a bit pricey, but the taste is still very good. Highly recommended.Delicious lattes and fast and friendly service. Definitely would come back and recommend. Their buttercream latte was sweet, but not annoyingly so. The perfect balance of sweet, creamy, but the coffee still shone through.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.4, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.1, 'authenticity': 0.1}",0.85,"3033 W 6th St #107, Los Angeles, CA 90020, USA",,5,"[{'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104782490933048173864"">Yeems Coffee</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4Jn32BfYhNaaKxcAAvt4gGEY7ujNAU0zK54VCx9PXeky25nv8L7FbUweTxn4LpFXmWku20wEHXS8kEeCFETrCV542XhtTJ_XiOWLqoBGPDzqokyxebKWGJAmeynd61AA2AN3NkAHSb11ixXRTP8Qj-0tx2fXthGiE8zkzw87dq1ajsV4DbRuXXwPb70kT5bDFqliIgjUOAXRVdY1FW4gzN19Kh5hooNSDySfr7GOh7D6npPy2uT8Qs5h6QFKfsh40QoqcO-lM9w79Sp9md6w0vTT7uiBwfcEMAPOFkIlx0Fw', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 2276, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104782490933048173864"">Yeems Coffee</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU49VxnPWbfv1bUBBrb6v5siEemaVcnY87yUfWttIjfw9GbtLic3QmPUAuxJMXaOM4yZpMHYhg05xN4FXVqSA-Q8HuyEdZTq7JqAsgiF-1pMuADPLL713vGZE0T-hEjOKojWEz6eg0n8iXQmV9NYUsd6PnlSqYOugqnBSuLwsvz0bnJWkCYbfDV5dUYxGa9ncekiZhDmDIHeg9eFMe4DDNyEgZPijB-4RKhpZgCCjh5I0x-oi8oS_Vlblhm1EoZvHhYZ4JuKGPjPncvEWvWZEGmGG0pUtYDtbKdIKcY1Fm8Z8A', 'width': 2276}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110025222509596900023"">Carissa Liu</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5bjo442hzJtMixDyGnpMV3qMpU51z7rwI-ABHp-KSUQvwYIxVlwrcVon9xprteNRk7Pv4_Jx-2KDu0_uFNC1oIKxmLNiZR-MBTSGVl1T7NGt5DYw4XGQR0n_EQqMugkgq_VAAwm6P6hG_iFSo6JJhJfjRMFV8I2e4cA2getqKzr0wvctuE_i6mCzUSYlupWPciGEW3vRUxHJkabkdhGRuoxqK7m6naPtmrgK8-DT80AobArfzrhhuPi6w5K_fHH5IcD0tryQDvub1nUpE8ZBeaBLRDhtiuzbq_09yFuGe3ukY_zGerPaNSwDaJQ3LsSUk0jTB0xGoX_gCiVS6X_K7eNik6NgwOkBNYMJ5_92D61wYRNjmDTwJIQZVLn7_DfPktxjXk7SC0eXlIx6w1ighs2JYAeMpW70CxxewJ_GM', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115605123451113348886"">iris liao</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4h3VflQLhf-gQcstMBTM5tTiKzOIlfnaDtLvIW3j_TzOU8TY1pVdGfOKhoD74K8CrpCllO7IRhxj66DI1yhSD2zh3ICH7iilK57Oft5W3QQzXUuge8QXR6XCmY8N-64AcDNEfGCHGIiF1cD1y5CdRxjRFTTTiZt6bYbmiZtnM3dbheuoHv5X90dQ40_bmiZ83YATCBGoZhcVBcv1_wQFEo8xWEbqLj5fmGkswbpFTdceTBVGgzjR4wMuTSzkv6DTY-5ZQIvSRaI0mX4avk5WcSwFqTrwGPURqqeA7a5mkgobefOHWo9HQvvmCULEc61SaH6uttCXNpSNo6wagJ6G-5sRrgleqrbaou4ZOIeNoDR-sPPV4FYZcllM1UGyicIJiXACNmyJNh4Kg1K8-CB007BmVP6cCLMg9zZ7pwXvQ9XpNinaehTcgzU7gwyUJW', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102240494570735904350"">Jamie Carr</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU60QaaHKeOJCJGrynZMq0US4bQcBmU6jzLUZXioATyLGJOVRjV3pwGVc_qyeqI8SQKCmejJ2oHkkZPoTXlu04-tlz0augwUuj8MC7TrpZlhLUhLBg88RY6Zko5kZ5gFaYI4GNadtqYDW0U4dbxHtxsIVwBL60TxJQk2ACDs6F_i5CuAFXiyixT_daqnvzbpcdAgyjFcRSNqr4Z9GL8YPBbbWMTpfAKagCr2zGg4D6WpVhU8ASWXAfpTXp-r8ssqivsVEvinxqU2on5B2MOPltU5ocPQDUW88jBs8V_5t3EAA4DlrO6b7ai1Ay73H_UpzUkGLZmshhxKn-Q3qihpvsp1CBGDWdNj7eXoGSI8cQmmZpcAB-_mblui_-GncbEt0dMjDMvesFsx8_qyX55W4J4K28CkCpl_3roNE7iIUcueKY6t1bVKnQQl3c_SqsPx', 'width': 3600}]"
17,Cafe Dulce (Little Tokyo),"Cafe Dulce offers variety of tasty pastries, donuts and coffee. I tried hot Americano and the Tiramisu cake. It's a great pairing.

Perfect for a casual stop any time before the kitchen closes at 6 PM.

The ham and cheese croissant was amazing too. No complaints.Very cosy outdoor, bench and umbrella. Quick stop over to cool down  a bit. Of course, mostly for take away because very limited seatings. The drink is marvelous!Great vanilla latte! Roasted to perfection & a perfect ratio of milk and syrup combination, what a great little hidden community gem!

20,Library Bar,"I love a bar with a concept and was obsessed over the library theme. Though not exactly hidden, the walls of books and intimate, cozy seating felt akin to a speakeasy. The contrast of the classic study aesthetic against the neon, almost cyberpunk-esque bar was surprisingly harmonious. Best of all, oNgl those fries changed my life lol. Super good bar food! Love this place. The atmosphere is great, there's really nice clean bathrooms, drinks are great, and the bartenders were so friendly. Music choices were superb, and not too loud. Small and cozy, so probably better for small groups or individuI’ve driven past Library Bar for years and always told myself I’d stop in there finally made it last night, and I’m glad I did. The drink menu is creative and fun, with cocktails named after books (with clever twists on the titles), which really adds to the charm.

The atmosphere is relaxed but stylI just went for happy hour.  Had the fish sandwich, which surprised me how good it was. Very limited food menu but atmosphere and drinks were great. Don't know why I never had been to this place before. Kind of have to looking for it to find from the street.Cool moment and feel in the place. I am a bit of a drink snob so I was a tad let down with some things but I stress that's just me.

It offers dining options and also has an outdoor area. The 16th floor is the rooftop, where the night view is fantastic.

We went up two different elevators and came out into an old antique room..the decor was from the early 1900s and wonderful. Paintings of naked ladies over the bar..cool chandeliers and lights and event he floor was really old patterns and the dining arThe food was amazing! The view was spectacular! I came here for the happy hour menu and everything we ordered was delicious. They also have a rooftop lounge for you to enjoy a drink and chit chat with a friend. I'd definitely recommend this place!This place was delicious! We got the steak frite, Chilean sea bass, the pesto gnocchi, and the provence plate . For dessert: almond cake, chocolate pot de crème and mango sorbet. All of them were very good!! For the Vegans: the Provence plate is vegan fyi😉. The atmosphere was very nice as well.

22,Frolic Room,"Went here on a Saturday morning. Late morning and fortunate to find parking in front of the bar. Please wasn't busy.

No frills about the esthetics of the bar. The sign is classic Hollywood, but very small inside. Beer selection wasn't great, so you may want to stick to cocktails.

Overall, don't exCool little bar, not a lot of room, but I think this is the type of spot you pop in on the way some where else so not a lounge type of bar. We met up with friends here before a concert and its was nice. Bar tenders were very attentive and made sure we were taken care of while we were there. I ordereWelcoming, No Frills bar! While walking down Hollywood Blvd, I stopped to look in and this Friendly bouncer (pictured) said, ""go on in and check it out,"" glad we did. Fun people, neat lights on the ceiling that I now know have been featured in movies. If you want a good, inexpensive adult beverage aA must-do experience when you are in Hollywood. It’s iconic. Always crowded before a show at the Pantages so getting a seat can be a challenge. We managed to snag a table after a few minutes and the staff quickly removed the prior customers glasses and cleaned the table, which was appreciated.

You don’t have to worry about splitting the bill! Every one can get their own tabs.

Great happy hour specialsI went to this spot last night on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.
The host, bartender and staff on the floor were kind and quick to assist. Blake was exceptional making suggestions on the menu and getting our food out quickly.
I really enjoyed that you could customize your espresso martini.the burger and fries were fine but was a decent deal for the happy hour. the chipotle dip the fries came with was really good. also got the soundcloud celebrity happy hour drink and that was good.Found this bar after trying to go to other spots in DTLA.

Eden also recommended great Rye and Scotch whiskies that I liked so much! Thanks Eden!Checked this place out after hearing some great things. Popped in shortly after opening and had Javier at the bar. Dude is super chill and very knowledgeable, talking me through different bourbons and teaching me about what I'd probably enjoy the most since im not super knowledgeable on whiskeys andI visited this place with my friends, where we enjoyed drinks, played pool, and listened to live music. The worst part is the waiting time; we have to wait 15 to 20 minutes each time we want to order drinks.I have loved coming here throughout the years on special occasions to drink with friends. It's a very chill spot with an old time vibe (built in the early 1900s) and has a good atmosphere. Seating is very limited, mainly has a bar area, 2 pool tables and a few booths off to the side (if you're luckyExcellent spot & great drink selection.  The Bartenders are great, the crowd is great & feels more casual to business casual.

Great cigar smoking area with seating on the side patio.  Also a great place to play pool.

It is adjacent to skid row so be smart about how you're traveling to and from. There is no clear signage - look for the opening inGroovy alternative + underground music including live bands on weekends. Cool dark atmosphere inside with lots of red lighting + crazy animal trophy heads on walls, sort of a weird David Lynch hunting vibe that's hip right now.

It’s tiny place that’s covered floor to ceiling with amazing tiki decor. Great drinks! I had the Ray’s Mistake and the Oooga Booga. Get there early unless you want to wait in line.No food. Bar only. Extremely limited seating so come early. Parking is a nightmare. Street only from what I could tell. Lucky you don't have to pay meters if you have a handicap placard in California.

Amazing cocktails. This place is an institution. Order the Ooga Booga or the Toro. Decent selectioAn iconic must-visit tiki bar.

My friends and I got to experience a variety of their small dishes, each delicious in their own way. The drinks were refreshing and perfectly balanced. Beautiful ambiance with good music in the background. The service was WOW is the best way to describe our (my GF and I) experience at Komodo Miami on 8/31/2025. Our first interaction was with a bartender named Jennifer. She poured great cocktails, and was friendly, welcoming, and gave some great recommendations! Over the top service!!! Thank you Jennifer!!!

9,Sexy Fish Miami,"Our table opted for the premium tasting menu, and it was a lot of food,in the best way. Everything was beautifully timed and served at a perfect pace, so nothing felt rushed or overwhelming. Each course flowed nicely into the next, and every bite was delicious.

The atmosphere was incredible!vibrant⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I had visited other Sexy Fish locations before, so expectations were high — and they were not disappointed! We chose the Sunday Brunch and the experience was simply incredible. The atmosphere is very pleasant, and the food, prepared with fresh, top-quality ingredients, was excellent from I had Sexy Fish Miami saved on my list of must-visit places for a long time, and finally visited it today. Sushi is my favorite food, and of course I tried it here it was excellent, definitely a five out of five.

I also found out that this place turns into a nightclub where people can dance, but siSexy Fish is probably the most stunning restaurant I’ve ever visited. The intricate design of every element is absolutely incredible…it’s an immersive work of art.

The design, led by world-renowned architect Martin Brudnizki blended opulence and playfulness in every detail. One of the most strikingSexy Fish – London vs Miami 🇺🇸

In London, the service is always top-notch — they help with parking, greet you warmly, and even if you show up without a jacket, they’ll always take care of you 😉 Everything runs smoothly, and guests truly come first.

In Miami, things started off on the wrong foot.

I had the Papa Bowl, which was super tasty and satisfying. You woukd expect it Staff are friendly helpful and polite. Coffee is absolutely fantastic. The food is exceptional and all very very reasonable when it comes to priceHere’s a 5-star review you can post for that place:

This spot is a fantastic addition to the Miami food scene. It has a cozy, inviting vibe and a great concept. I’ve only been once so far, but I’m already looking forward to going back.

The food is amazing—you can really tell the quality from Must try!! I have meant to come here and it did not disappoint. Great soup, sandwiches and juices! Service was good. Team can ask around more often how are you doing and as a suggestion provide or offer water. Very unique designs  with the brick floor and big plan pots inside. Very good presentationThe food was delicious and the frozen matcha was delishhh! The service though was my favorite cause it’s hard to find kind service in brickel. Adrian was an absolute sweetheart and made our experience amazing.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 1.0, 'energy': 0.3, 'elegance': 0.4, 'authenticity': 0.1}",0.9,"98 Southeast 8th Street, 830 Brickell Plaza, Miami, FL 33131, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113092821312211857964"">Ann Zakkery</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7y_uoYWel66OZmPfPrEQ9zURc2_zbmET243V23ZnccHiqKnhkzcuxhjT_Kx9TU_a6_2hG5ukBVbaKlbIMrqkoSFswAF7l5-EECcg9Du_YNAtDQisqe1WRe85E7XsHSVZo0aVDuxqe4hyKno6bNmgAuyBj7KhBeN_eO4gXq0De4JWcBZDSsXW_2H0hYo13_KWve8ZYLK1iBXzdvH1B3vZFaFXpJ9MGceZrF-ovxi2lu9XyKeyjdK7Ra15ZF9otzTQ9xZUxqX-J6IE2h4N2reIQEHRCKo7eaZ0rWahdpMkVsxS3ETMjM5R_AM7d8u8mCbbgoxcn2w8eHSDANiE4bZkOdvlMMtBVcNTOzlz5T21T1xVdeIED1C674bM6NgSJJ7o8uWqQ6yY6CV-wc01i00QZYTjkv0R_aqdK1OXmCOQxxbuykxMSM_vqo8CtvTA', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111039755673676979671"">kenza elhaddouti</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU54WMmhFi01aJYYDdPh5QDp66cpzhRBdwQKRxUtUUiG_mLnDsVUaii4Zd0zQXCWMW0pH7yYRO5Lg0Ew-QoAmOuQybVQ7fh6LkH7hwsilzcCplYVJPcodIXWQ-iHEKYFYIzsMLjwTiL0nUVKO5Y0OOfVjpCvIznU8bNrM2h0oFR58BUA2vIYsk4_v3UVPE1L8MeXOz6PY0vkuGfI1UgzOZgisUG4GpFrH_W55ML7xuQ5TDnoTcwiMwVCQ2m0sgNziwjiQTU8mu0SzFuPjciiDsO9Jmn5oCboSXeUYdsOIWYZqJFfqeeZ8MfTobH1DdCwObaQn-2blvcTlVHKYkveN3dMJXDLnReZyldSUQM3hv9vJad3Y5h5Apabho52idyxmdKOYG6crgN28Owj1pEwbFtj24KjhQSJukvONu59WDrXR1GkYejuAIcG94D_kw', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 900, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115872529692816455172"">maman</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7fpjCjaQklmHwPBMS9JBd4cvjvLuytmEK6_Eq-3Xy-0908SelroWwOI8aKHB6revRVwvbQJ5PgaFV7mFXhoENjZzJZr2vcz9LOUFgC6CK_BKuJzv6TxlOaI1ulAVcfFEmCBrmFgbe8n-XeLZEcRLnqLG6UZWwqNwoXtEIu5MlQeiUIUJNjs8_Vld_e79Z8x8ui_zuF0UqWclP8_gX_ftGuAJtCckn5KVL7tiXZvdvjruNGBrfdOeAE5IJ3-ncP1jq23b-KpmtBDRGfL_2Xm3_Rre-mP7acMSNXmx_ZEcRvmg', 'width': 1600}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111039755673676979671"">kenza elhaddouti</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7ruOqboCuuR1TaESOEY1gxtfbuBFNiD0u8yWoCd0yNGZAVdAVxNlOhme2P7HFgzCoEJvZrT4XM-BQEIcL8Aei0coltV4m6TALGn7RCDmmGQ_-3zMjFG0lfAsaBEBbe_Uw093fuE6AEnRTi6qZVRLcG9lGPmJLJm_F_IHHgA3ER_GaeuAN458PzhXIalI4iNCalQVch-op4dNc_jTqirym1HUU5wtwVnBZM_LdqVmMC1YR8zsiNogBNVH0c6EjlbaCeB5dsTliMkSCT_lveLxcKLF6ls6Golyey5DdTuYfz0n1z-P5iat39Z52zXUHt-YjAmGyAyq5Lbd16TJxohWqbCLHUaSXXyU2XoC5PzsgeRp_KuOwc4W1oh8v18oU0QQHtWbw2llEoj5r_1CUqWtcy_bAKSQJhginPBYMGf92AixvaAry9TPIAscx6T3fB', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 2000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115872529692816455172"">maman</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU44l9i0TN5ZTq-PfyeR_rC2oVVvur71HddXwpQMxRmd2_-TDImV_QqE2CrTQqKUk4lQTbZCAsnBLycNe-mFs1MIJf-W3FfJcXTuZ_VcIXL7v7U46wcS79InftpGQue4-H9k51UHnmIZwHkGJdHq2JAsfbzZi0MUYxwzL1b5dEbKzUul0iGGO6usbLaCtRKFy-ZtMfMk5-YYYOjkt-KTwlxERy-uHTzVzFy14omyKSI238zws1HIC6Y2Nkplg_ZHIpHDCM5j5hahaX2VBTbquqWO_ai6DqWaa0Z81UKbCT7ZsQ', 'width': 1600}]"
12,Magdalena Coffee & Houseplants,"I absolutely loved Magdalena! They offer a great selection of coffee (including pour over). I chose the iced V60 option and it was so aromatic and enjoyable. The place has a great eccentric playlist in the background. Easy to have a light conversation and still enjoy the groovy music. Staff is frien😋😋😋😋😋
I've been a loyal fan of Magdalene Coffee in Wynwood since they opened, and it's consistently one of my favorite spots! Their coffee is always fantastic, brewed to perfection every time. You absolutely have to try their Danish pastries—they're incredibly delicious and taste so fresh. It's the Magdalena welcomed me with a perfect parking spot right in front and with friendly faces taking my order! I loved the vibe of the shop, the light that comes through and all the plants. Such a great atmosphere to work and eat. I had a vanilla latte which I enjoyed so much! Will be coming back to try I don’t really know how living in this neighborhood for almost 3 years and been a coffee snob I didn’t find Magdalena Coffee earlier.

I’m happy I made it here. I love the ambiance, decoration, all the natural light they have and more importantly the quality of the coffee. Their coffee is just how IOne of my favorite spots for matcha! The lavender matcha is excellent. Their coffee is just as good. There is a selection of pastries that I highly recommend. Also, a small selection of plants and merchandise. There is some street parking and a small lot at the end of the block on a side street.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.4, 'authenticity': 0.8}",0.9,"321 NE 26th St CU-04, Miami, FL 33137, USA",,5,"[{'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102634212247618030504"">Luis Roberto Montaño Garcia</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4x-dQCn0iT7r7JB3QltyKQQ9cRGOilCKlHTqZL72yz_cI2OchuYZs_JLraI6lfJlc95G5trA9lMuAPaxp5cMcieammKbbx7a9BVepyH2-n5mj7WSdAb3AbBBoOtt5213Z4owZraNr9Dv8A8_Q_W-q20a-6w-1x2hWOJxIX7v00ci8GFBxUF2sK6lwMhncP3i5Uv_X-sKUEUQak8vvoe1BH3eiMP9qBaTlO594Ti1iidJQ9ugc0JaIzk49s9Fm6w1lR3BLj323XMZXl-joF99je_kWfsrUsIue61rJ2i2BT55SbUkxQNNCpmqYDrDRmFOb3DIoKHach-KtRhJZIcSucmKzYzKSU__x2hV9jZSx95bbY3QvPrn0ZMeS-nyfeABEC2fug6xNh6setk03Br5ueHWmYjj9hmsMIHeZ8-DO6L6dulBBP8BHEIJtSUImC', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 1080, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109836138513312891870"">Magdalena Coffee &amp; Houseplants</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6Mo-ruAL2iMYIIXpw3NiLXykbUu3DS7oJPvpZujLGdSb6Guibr0fprWv72tFTxpyzHFCw9ciy09qfK1hnbzoC1DsXsQaQO3bEaaGtKz1Dn1Zhl6rqVcwskRoBOFlEsFXhA4e9oyDTMgifxrHgg087hdtgFX_WjGFux1wKMVAI3h3nmCrKs6zDqPY6yRhr5DN9Uid86qlerHT84a2vQVxS_ZGB5Enc6N6T0_Gx_guimMfGFm8qDXd3AR4ZcA8eXB0CB2X-GzIOiQL798l6fKKQ2-p7idGDOu-jms02xTjnvug', 'width': 1080}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106767769402910468462"">Angela Galantucci</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6PnutClBQ-oQG9CXFhpY9eqbp3XDyXCqBaUA-HOZFvn0X0BMtYluSWAVbs6CbgDWAn1UJHvWwHo-0r5RmZzVD7q44BjkQ57N1FyY349FIOOoIc51jqrtYaiY33xxdFnR3-_Y39tXsFMyMcL-32RxEVSFiUejYzSCHiu3TrA2A4ojxEAUy4jlFHtZNrCaNKV-YxZREhVW5dzCZnRXW_In5GHv5auUj6gH8_pq2spAguJ6Wlh45DA-G7YuQEtRvh6QFghpTmab8-CsKdOYpcoPMDuddIO_z_ctVu_JYeXgtSOvYfsfPSMB0C9-Z1nsRVQG0AOdwAnhHajxtQ3DQ16Wyr-hMXzR_cxsAqXyTTUJngQI53TD5ObcR3mROHN5r7PDXKhXOy3RXDLA7x4MscuDsnboGfRP018oxA0FSR9Mlxpd5m1eeKzcWo51NZt1DC', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100473852967656548959"">Loreangel Camino</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5Sx2MKeHaEVEhxVkdeG5XdeW4mLnoyniic_-Oz2xxF5eSbZlVsK2XEe66JcmIPCVpp8A2SKVheInQSTn2vm4aVdrXNgNPky2UkNCQL4jg_R49S1JxXtkLk0mwC5yameOn1B2RUNZRfu8ltYjugejmW7PBJNvnIyWOEis4H--k29AOp9p1-0acSl2xHlrEO7wKxp2PP8HId1bdnM5S6A1fuqXgiR7F4p_fcOv6tsv8E1E7_WFIcnxCDdVZHYGYqUlH4R7vUUStcUFrjBo1_wMx7hwPW-S_IkN-Gigdbds3tjkCXRparPRbAk_4c8trQw8PjHdHLlivzB8euoeggTLn4xmZG8CSlsfU-YS7gjxveVs9ZvJw2OyId0uum-W_Fra--n5ba4_DdI-HOTaPO7owEF6rhLPcpY3NmQfT7akF7FzJEEmtY-6xo19NdYZvT', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106767769402910468462"">Angela Galantucci</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7LvPp3n0BpxHtHWBl7daYezs9LwJD7V7B1K_AAHvuY5LODzOsBexGvEmKFNfjYKP-maB_OmwLxBPsPOYt1fg7uQ_1N_yY51qM5ClGS1KVW-DdrnakI0FoHqgZHm8sxCNsgA1XHryZQCN9F2In0gmvTekuOjOjpgvV3ItUE9ZPjJoEHu30fdzRENqJEHQjbv_9miRj152XwU_TmP1HtUhuf5y-ZFt56UwIjZBrBieAAhHm73W0L8WCS4LST30e_3x79oR_VcNEjfF8HlBQh6JG-1P2JeGLirnBvj82EtNSN4htwyG1_FY1Eb6tuKXlDl7S-0hftNAZvz6KcrxDdZMrxeX9czcfrhL1lNKGVtXYvJc8TuZENw44f4J2V_5h21tA_NAm4idqXuxvU3U2Ne6Ac2mORuNbXv3XPWX5LTEu1tn2Cth_E7bunjHKPWDYD', 'width': 3600}]"
13,Bistro Café,"I have to say, from the moment you walk in, you feel welcomed. I loved the vibe and the atmosphere it has. The crew is very friendly and the food is amazing. Get yourself a Cappuccino and add a little bit of splendar! You will thank me later.Food is amazing. Depending on the time you go and your group there will be a wait time. But it is definitely worth it. The portions are big. I wasn’t able to finish my food and took it to go. Everything is so good even the drinks. If it’s coffee or mimosas it’s made to perfection. Not only that but Ran up on this place by accident, we were trying to visit Miami Slice, saw the long line and decided to investigate and what we found was some of the best food service and atmosphere you can find in Miami. (Angel the host was on the job, thanks for looking out for me and my lady) he got us in as sooJuan was absolutely incredible! From the moment we sat down, he greeted us with the warmest smile and made us feel right at home. His attention to detail, patience, and genuine kindness made the whole dining experience unforgettable. He anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, gave thoughtfuOur server Ashlei did such an amazing job! She carefully explained the menu, made suggestions, and made us feel comfortable.

14,Vanilla,"If you're looking for a cozy spot in downtown Miami that feels like a little slice of heaven, Vanilla Cafe is it! From the moment we walked in, we were charmed by the super cute, warm ambiance -- it's the perfect blend of modern and inviting.

The staff truly made the experience unforgettable. Anna I tried several desserts and they were great. Shakshuka (pictured) is very far from the original recipe and this dish should have a different name so as not to mislead. Will come back only for desserts. Meringue pistachio raspberry is my favorite today.We had such a lovely experience at Cafe Vanilla! The coffee was rich and flavorful, made just right. We also tried the Kyiv cake and the Ferrero cake - both were absolutely delicious.
The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, making it a perfect spot to relax and enjoy a treat. Highly recommend this cafThis place was such an unexpected find but so delicious! The vibes are super chill and welcoming and the staff is, too! The brownie and vanilla croissant were amazing and well priced, too!

TheSuch a great experience for my entire family — all 17 of us! While in Miami awaiting our cruise, we stopped by Miam for brunch, and it did not disappoint! The food was absolutely DELICIOUS and the portions were huge. 🍳🥞
Our server, Karè, took such good care of us and made the experience even better.Local & cute eatery! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and felt a super homey ambiance. The food was 10/10! we had some Miami fluffy pancakes topped with fruit & whip cream, a breakfast croissant with a side salad & a Miami sandwich with some side of sweet potatoes. I loved it !!!!My husband and I visited the Miam Cafe located in Miami about a week ago while we were in town. We were greeted promptly upon arrival. We then proceeded to the register to place our order. Once our order was ready, it was brought out to our table.

The area is beautifulAlthough I’m still quite new to Maman, I’ve already tried four different items from the menu, and each one has been absolutely delicious. I’ve even discovered a few new ingredients through their creative dishes, which has made the experience even more enjoyable. On top of the amazing food, the staffQuaint little spot.

Even though they were packed, it was quick and easy to get a drink, as the bartenders were very efficient. The music was great, and I love that there are different styles in the 2 rooms.Best bar/club in Brickell , been coming religiously for a while now.

The atmosphere is too dark though. The 4 stars is for the fact they charge a service charge along with the price of the drinks.

Nice selection of cocktails and place to hang out with colleagues and or friends. Cool atmosphere and dog friendly!!If you’re looking for the best pizza of your life, Losy Boy is the place to go. From the very first bite, you can taste the quality ingredients and the passion they put into every pizza. The pepperoni pizza is simply outstanding—a perfect balance of crispy crust, perfectly melted cheese, and pepperoClosest thing to a dive bar I could find in downtown Miami as an out-of-towner.

A little unnecessarilLost Boy Dry Goods is a cozy, dimly lit pub in Downtown Miami with a laid-back, inviting atmosphere. I had a hot dog and pretzel, both of which were delicious. The beer selection is top-notch, and the music sets a great vibe.

My food came out fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The staff were so friendly and made tTerrific experience! We were in town for a music festival (!) and found this spot. Food and service were both excellent. The coffee and Green Goddess salad to start set the tone, then the green chile enchiladas (me) and sweet corn cake Benedict (her) were flavorful, fresh and most enjoyable.

ShoutoWow! That pretty much sums up my experience at Caroline. Wonderful food and top notch service from waiter, Aaron despite the lunch time rush.

1,Corner Restaurant,"I had such an amazing experience while catching a late night bite. I came back to the restaurant 3 times before I left Austin. The vibe, energy and customer service was great. Everyone was down to earth, personable and welcoming. Kudos to all the staff throughout my stay.
•Carmine

•BraCame here on a whim after looking for restaurants in the area with good reviews. Service was excellent & what stood out the most.

Tried the brunch burger & wife had the burrito. Good portions & left feeling satiated. Food was yummy & got the job done.

A little on the pricier side for what it was, Great location and venue overall, service was unbelievably slow saw a few groups sit and leave during our brunch, luckily we were in no way in a rush but it was still frustratingly slow. Food was amazing, shrimp and grits are a must, breakfast burger was awesome as well. $70+tip for 2 person brunch Our waiter Adam was absolutely the best and so were the bartenders! However the kitchen staff needs a little work. For dinner, I ordered I ceaser salad and the wagu burger medium with no special sauce. The ceaser was to die for. My burger on the other hand came out well done with the SAUCE! Our waitFor a casual business event, Corner Restaurant is ideal. Its convenient location attached to the Marriott, diverse indoor and outdoor seating options - each with a unique vibe and quality food and service make it a standout choice.

2,Sour Duck Market,"Went during a happy hour, ordered a double with queso, a lemonade, a dreamscicle and a non-happy hour pretzel. I was happy with the food and ordered everything on my phone, which felt really convenient - but when I checked my credit card the next day, I noticed the amount the business was charging mPatio happy hour is the place to be. A large set of picnic tables with lots of seating and a great happy hour menu! The smash burgers were delicious and the drinks refreshing. The fries and squash didn’t hit the mark.

Officially updating my review - been back at least 5x since my original review. WI really wanted to like this place, their baked goods look stunning and the vibes are great. I went for brunch to scope it out for a date and ordered 3 dishes and a coffee to give it a fair chance. Again, everything came out looking spectacular. But to me, it didn't taste like much. Everything was bCrispy edged thin double smash cheese burger was pretty good. Drinks were also good. Service at the table from the QR code so easy to order and all very informal.Love the outdoor area, great places for family and kids.

I’ll definitely be back. The food was delicious—especially the omelette, which was outstanding. The potatoes were tasty, the sausage fresh, and the eggs cooked perfectly. The biscuits were a bit dry, but that didn’t take away from thWow. As a chef myself, I think what chef Andrew Amador and the team at Geraldine's really have something special here. The live music, the addictive craft cocktails, the flawless composed dishes leaving the kitchen had my girl and I thoroughly impressed, and our pallets pleased. Thank you TY for youWent for the jazz brunch, the musicians were great and the ambiance was top too. It wasn't too loud and we were able to carry conversation without having to shout or worry about loud tables.

6,Zanzibar,"Such a great spot! The open-air vibe with all the greenery is beautiful, and the seating is really comfy. We loved the tropical cocktails. The poke bowls were fresh, flavorful, and the portions were just right. Shoutout to our server Dee… she was so sweet and made the whole experience even better. DZanibar Is a 10/10 experience. They have the ambiance that you for looking for intimacy or with a group. The aesthetic set up is very pleasing to the eye. They are located at the perfect spot downtown as you can see the lady bird lake and also see the busy skyline of Downtown Austin. The servers werThis is a five star restaurant but keep in mind, This is not five star as in fine dining nor as in a hearty meal. This is more like small meals that you share with your friends over drinks. It’s definitely a night time before the club vibe, but I would not recommend this if you want a solid dinner oThe food and drinks are fresh, tasty, and surprisingly reasonably priced. The music and scenery set the right atmosphere.  The crew is fun with the tropical outfits, and especially Christopher W. providing delightful and fast service at the bar and bringing it poolside for fun in the sun!Absolutely loved the vibe of this place! Drinks and ambience was outstanding. And the view! 😍 my only feedback is I wish they had more food options in the menu.

Great choice of cocktails and I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything on the menu. The haloumi and fish were favorites from the main menu anWe had an amazing experience at Aba! From the moment we walked in, everything exceeded our expectations. The atmosphere was beautiful, relaxing, and full of great energy.

Our server Aiden truly made the evening special — attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. He went above and beyonI had such a wonderful dining experience at Aba Restaurant in Austin! Everything from the service to the food was excellent. Noel was my server and was so friendly, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu—she made the experience even better.

I ordered the short rib hummus, fried potaThis was my first time at Aba, and we came in with high expectations since we love Mediterranean food. I’ve had the chance to try several Mediterranean restaurants in Austin, and honestly, the one that stands out the most for me is The Peacock.

At Aba, the only dish I truly enjoyed was the crispy sTrifecta of greatness!
Wonderfully executed, fast, accurate process even though the waiter knew this was our first time. He calmly listened to every question and answered in detail following up with great insight on what we had ordered.

It’s not just two businesses coexisting - they’re part of the same operation, and some of the reviews you’ll find reflect the yoga experience.

13,Desnudo Coffee: East Austin,"We stopped by Desnudo Coffee during our weekend trip to Austin and ended up coming back three mornings in a row—it was that good. It’s a small coffee truck inside the Webberville food truck park, which also has great breakfast spots like Veracruz Tacos and a kolache truck right next door. Super convGreat coffee with a smooth and balanced flavor. Tried the tira-miso and white vanilla miso with orange blossom - they both were really good. The environment/vibe is very energetic and lively. The staff were super friendly and the service was also great. A bit on the pricier side though.Desnudo Coffee in East Austin is an absolute gem and totally worth the hype. I tried the Matcha Uji and the Brown Sugar Miso Latte, and they are some of the best drinks I have ever had. The flavors are smooth, rich, and perfectly balanced.

If you visit on a weekend, expect long lines between 8:30 aI’ve been on the hunt for the best coffee in Austin and, wow! Totally found it. The flavor is good and it’s consistent throughout. You know it’s good when there is a line at 2pm for 15 minutes to get coffee! The barista was super chill and they really have a great atmosphere as well. Tiki huts and LWhat a great find and awesome environment. Coffee and matcha were excellent. When we first arrived it seemed the line might be too long, but don’t worry because the wait is not long at all.

15,Haraz Coffee House,"Visited Haraz in Austin and really enjoyed the experience. I tried their tea, coffee, and a sweet, and everything was excellent. The tea stood out the most – so flavorful and refreshing.

The place itself has a beautiful vibe with amazing music and ambiance, and even their cutlery is aesthetic and wI got the rose milk cake and the iced mufawar, and it is absolutely delicious. It is a little pricey $7.50, but it is worth it! The other drink is the matcha with mango which my friend got, and was also very good. ♥️🇾🇪☕️I ordered the cheese cake and the chai. They both had such a rich flavor and very distinct, homey tastes. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt a very personal and comfortable. Everyone was very welcoming and loving. 10/10 place, I really want to go back to try everything else on the menu!Been here a couple times. Love the service and the drinks, specially that mango matcha! Shout out to Keyly! Always nice and greets you with a smile!I’ve got say, great tasting coffee and great tasting pastries. The environment was nice and enjoyed people watching from the bar type seats.

I ordered a Carmel Macchiato with add shot.. I really did enjoy their coffee, earthy but with a nice taste of espresso that will start your morning or day off","{'casualness': 0.5, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.6, 'authenticity': 0.9}",0.95,"500 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd Suite A, Austin, TX 78701, USA",,5,"[{'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117468783751279845359"">Haraz Coffee House</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4wd7KPzVdhXticMqdM6VpDDSrRPMQZxD7XajayFQNWyas9KQQpkdnwg1FoYP0kkHOjbUDbGKFC5qH_oiStVj2JAqLOqxGs8OPWaFPM3QD8nXXj5caR2Of2JtjIddcsJfwS5xZ0Xa0t9iVwmUub9FlK3xsKoa2BhevRZb7R9C7jKPePDzIjqiuuM2GMaKM5xt4kEG_n5eIrgmps11mJ6pDy098f2UWnOouhDz_IIIMWCJxrbDexNS5hc3UgURfSl1kiTpccoDp6dzOyQPDw0YI2Qvl2LqT3APzmnQRi0cfnNg', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 1478, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117468783751279845359"">Haraz Coffee House</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6Mo5l_dSWRnrIu2OGLHF1HTwUVHIGnfPInasA6ffMPrPfoYuSZ1-PnlUkWwdU41P2G4zsvvdTaasAKkowpcPubbH3pLBeBfKc7_9JIMp4UCGcOLQbVkmv55z3uWG9U4YBUO0s_ebyZ_xnPWx9GtArIp9XtypuaJ_kw7AM8cuDlSBXZ25Q-WMvdZykEP2FG-ndM1nNRjR2lxU5oXDuN9gvAAWLEsAGxq-CCPbqSbsT8840CYsXPdHv1p7jCcTxYFstul2vwI8mIW4RAhoQ8jGcjSP5nJZkCNPHXfCtxplhT3A', 'width': 1170}, {'height': 1471, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117468783751279845359"">Haraz Coffee House</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6w3kMeHufBgZVsZySztP6ZiVw7fAkGBigMDA2MQPYi-RmUefsNtC0mqsS8Kkf-M9X6ve9WdZtD6ezf4UL3DvyVy67edp2XnemMsa0GTjJ4ZZ_S6tKPGN_MKE4KSm-jLEt-43QtRdQGqOIyY3ZbSxawXhj2QlFUth0_kwLz-vpiTogwjJnl3MgzIqvkiNL6SSNs0vNzMwOjrYBE2BjGQKP9sVEaW6x3l7ehTOkjzWtdvRq4z7pWfIzhZjYwLLnSMjOIAL880OeOIQGLQlLzWrAGb2U3A8GfSKT_Ki_V9eYWGg', 'width': 1163}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117468783751279845359"">Haraz Coffee House</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7i5szBg3_p-Wsfqnl_2IIFoV8heHZoh7iBpZFcltzGyR0VXxBkJykmQal9bEwNHBaX9JAYXTLFdaB4Fr1NFiSuybKIFkM5TXJoACHphuA8G-S0hpVhGVO8OFisjVWQKkey9_A-uKjY9mvGpAbqy0_FMMp4jtgIyyLSSaM3ua-Rkj6322dxr7LqaldXpgamiKJf-njrcsXB5zqZ7x0jepvaCnYUomZeeIJ9V0CGqO_I4qD5ODk20UdxB_FstbnUSjUahLkzK2_pIoXf2EEaO6X6tvPKHPToraRiej7Tl0QJdw', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 1536, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117468783751279845359"">Haraz Coffee House</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5o5BtrTWtdiwlKsViMx_Oh7Li_tJqNE3WF4-jfWbdSVZtCDTBk9wQXePVa4VrD79pQfQEaD_PhcUPy_zswo8itJHGJKpiMymQm-XaKluVOqsjrOUhFkSi74n4KL3HsT0FGBW8EXaCo1BoV5Tp5WT13w0SQhleK_269MS8yHx_XQla48M_ImzT9oy-c4KsmNGXyNhx_ILfDoS7OA9O3JBVXM3GA_xXniJcCd_8ELqV3ku-6cCncqKsv0bYpX0lLaYdPFet2DdG8FtC-aNZ9hBXoJY4OcjpCiJPZ_GRDkR0XEA', 'width': 1024}]"
16,Mozart's Coffee Roasters,"Good place to visit with your loved ones like family wife friends and all. They have the best coffees and desserts. I love strawberry cheesecake and chocolate frappe. evening sunset timing is the best time to visit as they have outdoor seating.This is my favorite outdoorsy coffee place in Austin — and hands down my favorite waterfront coffee spot. The lake views are stunning, especially at sunset, and the outdoor seating makes it perfect for relaxing and a must go if you’re visiting the city.

This place is an Austin classic for a reason.The coffee and desserts here are absolutely amazing! Every sip and bite is perfection. The ambiance by the lake is superb — relaxing, scenic, and the perfect place to unwind day or night. Whether you’re catching up with friends or just enjoying a peaceful moment by the water, Mozart’s never disappoiGreat place, gets busy quick

17,Better Half Coffee & Cocktails,"Better Half has been on our radar for a long time now, so we popped in for a late weekday breakfast.

The property is really nice with a number of inside seating spots as well as plenty of outside seating under some lovely, old oak trees.

We ordered the Breakfast Sandwich (with sausage), the Fried I’ve visited this restaurant three times, and it’s consistently solid. My recent Saturday brunch really stood out. The food is flavorful and well-executed, with a thoughtful concept that shines through in the menu. The space is clean, modern, and stylish, creating a welcoming vibe. My only gripe is Truly one of the most mediocre places I’ve been to that is trying to be trendy. The breakfast sandwich was so underwhelming for the price. No seasoning, no salsa, no sauce. Just a bunch of fried elements without seasoning. It was very one note and nothing to it. Difficult to eat.
Coffee was okay, muGreat Vibe and Good Food, Definitely Worth a Visit

This is my third time coming to Better Half, and once again, it didn’t disappoint. I ordered the half Chop Chop salad, the single chicken bacon burger, and a veggie burger.

It’s hard not to like this place. The amount of property they have means yWe loved this place so much on our trip to Austin that we went a few times during the week.

18,Neighbor Coffee & Friends - Burnet,"Got the iced bourbon caramel latte (one of their specialty drinks) and it's delicious. Caramel with a savory finish, but not too strong to where it overpowers the espresso flavor. They also do punch cards!I came because of the great reviews and ordered an iced latte and sausage biscuit, which I've been getting at a lot of places lately.

The latte tasted like coffee-flavored milk, and the sausage biscuit was stale and dry, like it had been reheated and sitting around for a day or two.

The cashier waFood truck very conveniently located on the way to work. The espresso handshake is phenomenal. They also have some small bites (loaf, biscuit, sausage biscuit). Great service!Rating: 4.6/5

We were in the area, ordering lunch from one of the other food trucks, when we stumbled upon this coffee truck. The bourbon caramel latte caught our eye, so we decided to give it a try.

19,Noble Joe Coffee Co.,"Gotta add on to the reviews preceding me… the coffee is one of the best in Austin and definitely worth a drive to find out. Alongside are some fantastic breakfast options in another truck. Take your dog, and enjoy a chilled atmosphere on a weekday or weekend.We came for breakfast at Brunch Brunch Baby and noticed the long line at Noble Joe Coffee, so we decided to give it a try — definitely worth it! Ordered the Noble Matcha and the summer special Blackberry Latte (iced mix), and both were delicious. Great flavor, smooth drinks, and a fun spot with an eMy favorite coffee in Austin - I love the iced cherry macadamia latte! It always hits and the divas behind the bar are the sweetest! 10000/10 recommendGreat people serving up some of the best coffee in Austin! Stroll over to Noble Joes, they won’t let you down!! They love the community and their regulars💗Hands down the best coffee in Austin. I was SO LUCKY that I used to live in that apartment complex and could just walk out my door to grab some Noble Joe in the morning. But when you don’t live right next door, the location is right.

20,Edge Rooftop,"Located in the JW Marriott on the 5th floor around the corner from the pool.  Their hours are 6-12am everyday.   Hours may change when weather begins to cool down.  On Sunday they have Sunday scary night where they have a selection of martinis for $10.00.  I tried the Red Lotus for the first time, wWe loved the vibe up there! It’s beautiful. There’s a great view of the Capitol building. We were there for a conference, and the Edge was a nice place to sit and talk afterward.

The food portions are huge and tasty.

Our server was incredible! She took great care of our group of six.We had an amazing day in our cabana celebrating our friends bachelorette weekend!  Colin was an amazing server and made the day so much fun.  He was super attentive and personable. Enjoyed the comfort of the cabana and would definitely recommend!Great view! Great place for few drinks at the end of a long day. Live music was perfect. Drinks recommended by Jae did not disappoint. Jae was very friendly!!! I’d def recommend the Edge Rooftop and we are def coming back.This is such a amazing rooftop bar, Colin recommended me the soco marg and guess what? Was the best margarita that I ever tried, I like to put sugar on it and was just delicious same as the nachos.

Definitely on the pricey side but for a special occasion with friends, it was enjoyable.","{'casualness': 0.5, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.7, 'elegance': 0.8, 'authenticity': 0.2}",0.9,"310 E 5th St., Austin, TX 78701, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 843, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111522890811247884551"">Azul Rooftop</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU689nAT91NV_YKElZ84EvQI-RZX40CzoLe84GlJCHk-JgNBqYXpiy_kJCSL-pYJkvB8eYICqS0ErZIQbxR0thCxi7vK31BMOQQR1GH1zqdstI6oZRquGcH8SiQiZ1UErbrymm8tEOq3cXWPdxSpqZ0SwIsUHoJ4HBuaiHwYjjrEhWSEHrwZjHJGhtwPbgLQyHYXDNdRBolG1g8OTrwEBzBBXyA5mlBzelgFW7MBpJZQGQnHJQ7F2SBmSAYbvZ77Uc0E9uGsCoaBmEiu3SJACTAucXe4tlmbNJavODfXB-Or0Q', 'width': 1500}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102449833840350277090"">Yosvani Benavides Pérez</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7Ghjr7KJMkabiSQF4PTsLaVySk6DBzvMEOB1obdznVxeZC22PdATxCUwC9DJvZvDtFW19ngt_wpgzyA6nDxD23p589QYFsq5mLEAx-hkssrioqKrdM0Cb5ZxeMfl5Ac9hN_lGZye6yckBeOSqiZjskvr3jn9wUC4bK1W5RAanVeYKRfx-HzCToto_J_sa0BbLQpgA0UL8F0YnRE8lixNxa0nDMusfbzj0oY7nMgfn6deK4WZ78JYXovyiA91TukeRYLj8BgnRG9HYUB66JbVM4Zq1swenQI2IYkc5mh3hGNls0s-R9D44aohRm4zErW5kVkL9jlBJUa3AtWtEmmpKwnQ5aVmcTSnVQDdBq03qX03QJTsZkcSVNO98AR612_L6XgHRsv_c0oJPltLPMq4kmVmNIxdYkjfDspFJgIIImNqMa', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3472, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116095140681462142042"">Dennis Obie</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5aMcN9iW6PBxBI35EqR3hbzFC7HHsGWrwOh42IaEv7BdSokTqgfA20Qr0aQOpd1pcSFuim1SBlZBuqG892ericZy6mcl6pq7q9fijTO3fHy0DS6jrfOGP7JdRZgSiocKmkKysQ2tSSdHFDtnar1hVxpBwYztLXFUzX9eGC3NhYFWlHa2nqZvFDnvANKkW_nQr4tsWXtMP6ViTke9mG9ckjbvjJDCcDaVKZG9oUJsVzZ3UFoCOzp0N9VwxjiT20Ncrfz6DZlxoeh5RFr-aVyPYBcA9odKdzmLBgbYjNLW8bVzlWVz5XcoYal5iiiNJibZNbVlUqKjoJyWEepUtaHLJmHd07cPQUBvmFFv-ApvGvZUwigHXuhotyeZcOlESq3oWHLiu0hDXp8JRd9tIjieISHwmnOXPOQNYFHVcwktA', 'width': 4624}, {'height': 2604, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/101162751453899141917"">Linda Clark</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6JMmmxOaz5Kh9RpHq_US9D1Qe1ZpBEwUGtOFbLSCeSXRxp2YBRvS5WweQ9PS7OtxP4w0l9kxx7P6_-rUH1XQxnqtkupmgqpmRqhkHC3F9rWUEF9OD6UFFR0nzPZ5ir3WopeH7WIUqkkZ1eTq_u1ALDHR1hnMPg2WE7WUo3bZ92xpNdFJn9PRFXl4c7zZ1eqOkSGj_rSU3i87aXkrwb2eG-9m5Z7vOs3rlZDXWO3m9nJ2zj0CLa2dPCnxEaD2GM8nW6ATpYfjbbHFvYf3LgklWov9XWsC8s8miH8QvpuCTzdUVhX839qxgJYtgBqxC-iGc-FXLaRuFjeMaFK7imc5p-on_qIiY6IfRXtjNQxK-rc5BGHbmX3CAHn2n0jC-1HS0rH8LTt_Mv6ITswOo8yh1nhIRv_VWbqImeh9f4zqTWuSc', 'width': 4624}, {'height': 3000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105590478232528880735"">Helen Granchukoff</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4EyEqNFASWZCJuezWPilQJWV7A-mwS2RjZ43owNgz3MJUTsW5zPEYTO89kjf_7JO-rOEypW2YfqhxbsWsTNtw-RRdJjW1VhRAizQOrNmn0ZvmYCf0Q8AhbkTHfFV7XTIAIhLyrYWeMDof1DOLB1f-5rJO2dwnOOJ3qU8VVKw8_J-GLGVVQozISt7Z0WvNZWgsc3OcwN5AT6j3jSmlPW5fxLZAi7w9zupoOL1SVJXa9fvUTPZpuguQyzvmj32Rk_WCQvEXqRqjgiT0fHWgo1fcC099hzoFLJfBTJaRPBh6EwpX4Sk-uXoJLmCnlrVD6-vWqJTxArEnRzka8e8eEMrhvkQG1rzqG71ef--SLTkzwLqaA9x9JdcADoxmEr86pLQnI2v1yoHlLJqIOyCJpOzYel8VZcj-jWWjSdqtdr48', 'width': 4000}]"
26,Whisler’s,"Rating: 4.4/5 [dine in]

Our friends wouldn't stop talking about Whisler's $0.75 martini summer special on Wednesdays from 4-7 PM, so we finally made time to check it out. We got there around 5:30 PM and luckily didn't have to wait in line to get in. They handed us two white drink tickets for the maWonderful character and authentic decor. Walls are covered in signatures, drawings, etc! They even have sharpies available if you want to sign. We sat outside and had seating right away on a Sunday afternoon. Lots of fans and misters available outside. Drinks were wonderful. Wide variety of options This place is where the hype outweighs the flavor. Big, crowded, and trying way too hard—each $25 cocktail was a messy mix of ingredients that tasted more like a bad smoothie than a drink. Bill was $100 for four drinks and left unimpressed. Cool vibe, but pure hipster tax.Super fun and eclectic bar with indoor and outdoor seating. Craft cocktails and very nice staff. They’ll also make you anything based on your flavor profiles too. We loved the cocktail happy hour menu and candlelit ambiance inside.I was walking past when I found this cute little place. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The mezcal bar upstairs has almost an “illegal speakeasy” vibe to it just adding to the already amazing selection and service. Ideal date spot and some beautiful vibes and ambiance.

27,Mean Eyed Cat,"My absolute number one favorite bar in Austin and probably all Texas!  Great atmosphere and super nice and fun staff!  Always a fantastic time when you come here.  Walls are so interesting with old Johnny Cash posters and art, stickers and stuff to talk about.  Great merch too, get a hat or shirt!Atmosphere is always awesome, def one of not number one fav bar in Austin, huge patio, huge! And always chill even when busy. Gabriel was great, made the weird drink request i asked for and chatted for a moment as i came in after work alone, cool to small talk with someone while unwinding, better thThis place is so cool! I'm a huge Johnny Cash fan so it was awesome to see all the Cash memorabilia.  Shelby is such a great bartender, she went out of her way to chat with my husband and I, and tell us about the history of the bar.  I will definitely make another visit on my next visit to Austin!Shelby was great. I came into the bar and she tried to sell me a timeshare in south Austin, but it was a great deal. After a couple a beers, I caved but it was overall a pretty decent deal. She waived her commission. 10/10 would recommend.This. Place. Is. Amazing.
The staff was so so nice. Decor in here is so cool. It’s mostly Johnny Cash but everything about it is great. If I lived in Austin I would frequent this place all the time. The outside seating is just as great.

28,Nickel City,"Is this the best bar in Austin? It’s in the running!

This is not your hipster bar…this is a true Texas dive bar.

They have a great bourbon selection at fair prices.

Bartenders are top notch! The food is delicious! Better not touch my tots!Cannot visit Austin without going to Nickel city! The food is delicious,  not the cocktails are even better!!! I always get the pink drink and tater tots!! Their bourbon selection is impressive!Atmosphere was divey but still welcoming. Joey was awesome, super attentive and personable. I will come back just for him 🫶🏼We went here for national hot dog day! Had some great dogs, exactly what you want when you want the classic! Nice frosty beer too!

0,Six Seven Restaurant,"🌅 Perfect sunset dinner spot.

Came here just before sunset and the view was absolutely stunning — definitely one of the best parts of the experience. The salmon was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the gnocchi with mushrooms was rich, earthy, and comforting. Service was consistently great througLoved our evening at Six Seven! Gorgeous views, great food with generous portions, and surprisingly reasonable prices for the location. It’s classy but not too formal _ perfect for hanging out with friends, taking photos, and enjoying the vibe. Our server, Justin was friendly, attentive, and made thDelicious meal- but make reservation. We were waiting for our room to be ready and enjoyed a meal - there were no tables available and only smaller bar tables to eat our meals- it was so busy. Definitely reservations. We stayed after our cruise.
The hotel also has a small cafe. But the food was deliBeautiful view, day or night. Absolute wonderful service~
The bread, the salad, the clam chowder, and the firecracker shrimp were all very good. Can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu next time I'm in Seattle.
One thing to note, if you don't park and walk from somewhere else, Valet tWe came here to celebrate the retirement of our Business Manager, and we are so delighted we did! The service was absolutely spectacular, and the food was amazing. I especially loved all of the delicious vegetable options — but the prime rib was outstanding as well!

1,The Pink Door,"TLDR; go for the dessert, drinks and appetizers (in that order)

We came in for a late lunch on a weekday and were very surprised to see how busy they were.

Food: between the two of us, we ordered 2 appetizers (mushroom crostini, arancini), 2 mains (eggplant penne, spaghetti and meatballs), a drinkThe meal was a delightful experience from start to finish. The seafood was incredibly fresh, with clams and mussels cooked perfectly in a rich, buttery broth that carried just the right touch of herbs. The crisp bread added a wonderful contrast, soaking up all the flavors. The salad was refreshing, If you’ve never been, find a way to make a reservation! You arrive at an unassuming “pink door” in an alleyway, and it opens up to a beautiful sprawling restaurant with packed tables. The place is bustling with live music, views of the bay, rustic Italian food, and apparently, at times, cabaret and Placed a reservation via OpenTable (highly recommend). Those without a reservation were told it was a 1 hour 45 minute wait. Server was nice. Live music in the front area as you walked in. It was nice and warm inside. Got the bolognese, lasagna and apple pie. Very good!What a fabulous find! Started with a bottle of Planeta Rose ($53) accompanied by the freshest Bruschetta ($22)! The tomatoes on this appetizer were so red and ripe and BIG! Small Caesar ($15) was enough for 2 people. Lasagne ($27) was heavy with plenty of garlic and herbs paired with 3 meatballs ($2","{'casualness': 0.5, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.9, 'elegance': 0.8, 'authenticity': 0.7}",0.9,"1919 Post Alley, Seattle, WA 98101, USA",3.0,5,"[{'height': 1365, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117575494211128178071"">The Pink Door</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6CCwrYYiUpLXrJLGOwJ2jME9G-nWbkqi3lNW6MdFT-b5rC0xeA03QsGesulg_SgXGDbYjetJOftZnm7GPLCUEntZQ_th8D4i-baOH4VBhouUh8etb2NByBXq967M-IsK1alXqlKx3mM0CQ4N77Nqmi2DUhsIKBY5GIvhga3INBbFn8uJhfAvoxK6lPbIIPk6D8gab0tJuVxUVRKa8lRn7a12B-TqBvSYtmm6KUpbBfNchB_PIvsDvNQPVAPhSFcwYCbpyW_S7oVvkCI9gdAv2E2k7Jywn7mB0zfZYux8Z1hQ', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104685137986952562179"">Judith Mendoza Lomeli</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4COv-v-76iHfu2TCxiwNkZRL_NRIxEyExhwp3IvVBP1gzC4SOi_LkLiAla6Ebk07mxOqotOFmc0P72kp8q27SsaKIpCti-SPRQUEQItkVzv-gPp06eYfvZvVH4qeg73twLWEYEvZf0RymupXClAmEhimzDitpgGhV7P5zdmRAIivVqyL6gn6LFx7N5t5WRPvKu3dQX2tzFVtM_PnZZvM3D0ff4Fl_BEidSllT3lfLmFGw7BFJMVgeb7cqJxy7s4Yese_c2Z1YZt3WLKMWVtkSPEUEZT9XEt_2G4s93x5-_wWtKitbHGi9TpeNrvELLdaxPTWnvpFz0z5vixK6QhBrRpJuu0sH4pls8_H_ZPpn6rprMuhMA-vH1ZhRqj9AC5o1LtOjxXuIIIHnU3MMRXEl6xOcraDDoYRsvmXfp78bP-Ua3GkHBDoozhFWlmzVb', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 3203, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117575494211128178071"">The Pink Door</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU49hETZfZ9UJev4NfYl022yzzpyvr6IfUQiM5epx-5OKgSt_r8gYqNChu2G_kRqzZTJPBTjol9DB_UV7x2s-YDbPH5yBbkQ6U2lz6uY4-IDsrGsPzhB7ni4eE2Ay2fh8VrLE4Po1XMGs7COPPQeX8SmAsuWlyaq0X3jk3n6nbIF0wo0-Rk5VHoXXHG_YPUFx6gMd-zvDEIL44cAyAIRpnOqqSZUXLTGKfpbkjpfc9m8xNYbTYWq835arwt_kFra70uma45yFKAGJkfMHi3-aK-g6dftTwkjfXmuWiEDfPf85w', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104685137986952562179"">Judith Mendoza Lomeli</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6RiCnAFE2PlaQokgEgoXtaQqTbExchQ-fJU7u1BOJs67nQ6Y5WPvH4_UQoj1JN5aWi9CPjbsX7IuJlsqetRoJrf3zzxvtaUX9jwKQoZYjm2gFimDtdwEsgLuVt8OoM8vyWs01rLyE-tSn4iNTQYtcJUGiowWJaDoWzz5AZK9kZTEyN6V0qHFakBcbtir5GUOjkpvh2p5kMiU4yTu1jePbRX2vf8M0CW3ChmitAJO35qkRK3Fy7GoI4XM4glwSsOypVTSfVkf-rUCCBZBa2H27M5VwxvLIMF3lgXP1bseij9pFJbqTYppFTti_AANy18cZ9xoUKMrlB-427hprcW32FeYP11fLfAcNhPlO6AfkDAnyu4V9G_WBWNBURMRm1eX-C59yG9f1pkffVeL7R-qeP9iX0Eki91d5M_e0umHjZY8jT4G-dqdOBkhhsZ8p5', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100324963252852846829"">Yuri Kim</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6TpaKDv6npv4xeSYplmHyZOHkmZqkZEcnbXe3e_4wqBcsDXiCfLRyReR7NgT8xbpDHjb4R3DBksuguTrkbdeZOalrzeBU0jZgMiG_fTsV7QMtR_orFchnP9F_6PSgVvLiGEaWicMl350sJ0IHnQvJFpnAnllcd_nYdWatvgqHiV-L2Y3X7Dj1cZSX7GsCyA7OIzrdXLbzvpJqqAcSwek3gezMWPSsaSjcZ5xbA3aFY4NFTEj6GYCuKEHERoXheuejCzgDkirchmvMbIF4yLwXGd-eOzT_JFonyuM9tfieRNZAAUG18ov2KxEgnzuARkd5eFtyUtI1OVf45ZaRPV2VybJTNVBi5hpyZkCy4dim5HgPk4Nfhk0vPyzbLxGPOK9y96GUbGMdYgDlr_EA2s637QQkFIyZBlWsAuIH2kd5u6OolEzyllGq0gYPZCA', 'width': 3600}]"

I left off a couple of stars only for a few reasons:
- the We had an incredible evening here. The service is top notch. Our waiter, Mack, knew everything about every item on the menu, and described them perfectly. We never felt rushed, even though we asked a lot of questions. The support staff was very stealthy at times, when I would realize I had new silveIt was ok. Wouldn’t come back for an $800 meal.

3,Alder & Ash,"Sat at the bar, nice place. Convenient for a quick but yummy meal.

The Adler and Ash burger was tasty. I wouldn’t say it’s special but decent. No blue cheese stuffed olive for my dirty martini but the server made up for it by being so attentive.
Happy Hour was pretty good. $10 menu list was pleasanFood exceeded our expectations!  Great portion and good value. The restaurant is part of the Sheraton hotel, so it’s a bit difficult to find.  The address will take you to the back of the hotel where you’ll be greeted with a sign telling you to go to the front of the hotel.  Not ideal and a bit wastJoyce was amazing!!!!  We are from Canada and first time in Seattle and at this restaurant. Service is top notch , breakfast had the best Ava ado toast I’ve ever had and the decor was sensational!!!  Highly recommend.  Jim & Michelle ❤️Great burger and sampler platter. Everything here looks amazing! Just was craving a good burger tonight. Drinks are well thought out and made well. Would highly suggest this place if your tired of restaurants missing the mark.This is a really beautiful lounge, the furniture is so plush and comfy. Came for HH before an event at the Paramount.  Food options were really good. Hh drinks were tasty also. Servers were very attentive. We would definitely come back here again.","{'casualness': 0.6, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.7, 'authenticity': 0.2}",0.8,"629 Pike St, Seattle, WA 98101, USA",,5,"[{'height': 1821, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105861155328563772041"">Alder &amp; Ash</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4HzDMja8cJO9CG2wDlMtFxgOaXYL8NrpZppdxydwIKOc_EdGv_kepfZTjnktWQhMiNEeodKgSP8WifHAPtgZd9UvUOLnTnh0zCmpd0vtP2Vu90wfdy6WukUv2iZlm1ydQNVy1-e8lzW16FsEZSCNBnbQ4HVE5Y5Sydsx4--MtX4WVNWpk6GQ7GpBqhnT7lRYTryMDryUlEuHwPTuKKWt-iYxg-02P0Ywtteh-HH7BxWpJjiB6egy9U_53FT_t-hImZyyxIEku_roxc32NpQQTwCRa4UOHX3vnEZhtW5pmwpw', 'width': 2731}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115411665233588716809"">T Niemeyer</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU77AYPjNMO6oFfvQBSQ2mCpJEW38BfcIf8MIkRpAqDuZ25X4cyjzYPGEkjUMaT70bm-E_Y6nAPIBSh7K3yi3cxhQAwxoPLjpZzbool2WePZVclGV8oM_5OpeGONQlFtta-BLzYB7Zxb_6m5V9w_8OHhV--mOKLJZhmI3Wl0PChPU6xAdIwNZPpFnMbKYLIi_pMwhVffAARAzzizaQ4Gx1VEwhGWwpHYSm_wodTRW_YWWBLiU6ZwFQj1RafVVQUXk1GCY3cyBo8E4eIeTtUelGCObu8lXoz_7WocavP_Kl_tOVHvR0Fw8QNNPbRVComvgUD9WEc0YZ2V2Dnp7TQjfE1rzPjyYauj3VWb-axdRITNArLHlR6TX1FYwsWA61qbhIl__M19rtl_KiKJut9VvG_kbQRyxbmB_QMNkMIaQIyvrCfw-VmyhuhIlDTD8q8Y', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 3201, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105861155328563772041"">Alder &amp; Ash</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6cj9aWvrcg2Kl-UPQA9WUxpj7w3w1wj7duD8kEU2dwMHoR_DOkNMqzYajinnJkyXrn3XUR_RHJVU_frX8R1A--Ko28V645kLRb3cOkvKEZMrXw4RSd99UN647hk6WmClBc605qlc1Xmu_k-rQwo2jdivk8U7B0XGyc53dO-E4wi0fpHsPiJOs5yQVhd04Ku2DM4pK9kcqFq8VksGpA3e7DGG54MchchSdiSKdyZxoAIUi50pB1Iy3wiflIgjPZUlei2-LXBvsv8BclHM4oSB5xHhC-MwKr42PRYXIVHz99Bg', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115411665233588716809"">T Niemeyer</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU69D9E5y5Kstne_j8u6lecHAyhi19AMcn3DpD4OqviVqFmU8BRi9EJmo9wuURLeh5wgR7JGrAYjNlce20_Cu2Q2CDPF3eOWVIxfksRc-v95dHk6UGDdVQZAbg_j6ks6TH0lhKRyTVZ8njzMLCmf6xX0P-w39fthqFYGiI3ifhEtYaW0Ry59FZU-nrmK10uQqyLBPlrqQmFAdraa2LxvFn3udwCb6qSQ67JyLjjZd97QfWHOas-nxppsOjB5akM74V6Grhitok7R_nZPohba5nmS7fGt_rvIgEGvqdZo-JIrEIEM_VPtM-UTVGxB4JNoav8aDf_3Uw1wESSj3VFqM5M_PWX-M_M7ei6GNGAy6XV8Mo0i3LGKOCZS_BLKWx0tRocngaIw7Ep6Ksbh61mFL8HDyCi3FQhFWH4OZY1XWtNSQO9SAZo17kFqcHlmfSP_', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116514210055982758817"">Megan Galbraith</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5IfB-4OJVRYwbjLHWby-gguJNRNi49-KDBYMu4_OlspLLLHp5E1AU3uudmauZQwVQ2geYW_zdfPERLEj_fMREHyNIJMgz3RUXUZLjvHCRftzDDWnhO75_gRSJ1iyX1QpUaXtka2jI4x4duDAlekzQLG_t_fJuGWwC5Bc6XWErEQvKS9ItInZAij_RT7q2lq3V8ewLJ3jxhQJ7_Y2w7fqBb4VUIrjQlhjXrW5aAyhZEbp3O-DrdJcOWp8RO7qvSfqy3HIJevYUHze8WvB1RUMS-519Aj75aUTUKI2bTY3Q6HgO7SsvkVhBUMImTzjlFxUi3aVRaVhVOeniRck9V5qRKvmhFswFQMlVnaSt47bXu3hmJea-2O2foS1rF-9DlvulpfdEAvFKoYckFKeKXY_Zpm6Oty5Dnn23C4JdLUlP0c04', 'width': 4800}]"
4,Lola,"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. My friends and I were speechless—literally silent—because we were too busy savoring every single bite. Each dish was a perfect balance of flavors, and our amazing server made the experience even better. She suggested we go family-style so we could try everything, and it waWe went for breakfast on Sunday morning and it was packed, so we had to wait about 20 minutes. The good thing is they have a lounge where you can comfortably wait. For this reason, I think it’s definitely a good idea to make a reservation.

The staff was super kind and attentive — they brought us waWe came in at late lunch time (dinner menu), the manti is amazing, it’s inspired from the Turkish Manti and is very flavourful, the lamb is tender and moist.
The chicken kebabs are succulent and arrive at the table with a sizzle, we ordered some pita to pair the kebab with.

It’s a great place to peVibe check: perfect. Visitor or local this location is central to so much. I stayed at The Hotel Ändra next door and this combo made my trip so easy. Breakfast is great.

Our server, Hector, deserves special recognition. Despite the full house, he took amazing care of us —Food was fantastic especially the duck and the roasted potatoes. The duck was cooked perfectly and the roasted potatoes were extremely crispy and flavorful in a large shareable portion. Cocktails were also great. Open kitchen style so you are watching as they’re making the food! Great service and amWe came here for a team dinner and enjoyed ourselves. The food was very very good and the service was decent. However the service was rather slow. It took us well over an hour to get our food, but when it was served it was delicious! I would recommend but go early and order quickly then sit back andWe ordered the fish, duck and mushrooms.
Fish was amazing. Duck was still good and tender but the mushrooms were covered in salt and fried so much you could not taste the mashroom flavor. Do not recomend this one.

6,Elliott's Oyster House,"My wife and I walked in for dinner and the restaurant was clean and on the water and looked very nice inside with the wood and oyster selection. We told them we are visiting Seattle for our 15 year wedding anniversary. When we arrived to our table they had an anniversary card for us. Our server EdieI don’t usually eat oysters, but this place completely changed my mind. The oysters are a must-try—sweet, fresh, and full of flavor. The restaurant is set right on the harbor, so you get a perfect waterfront view while dining. The vibe is casual yet classy, making it comfortable but still special.

This was my second visit to Elliott’s, located right on Pier 56 along the Seattle waterfront. As expected, the place was packed, but we lucked out and snagged three seats at the oyster bar for our party of three.

Service started a little slow since David, the oyster chef, let us know we couldn’t orAmazing food, don't let the 20% service charge fool you, it goes to the company and the server gets a 12% commission on orders. The 20% service charge is to cover additional labor costs for employees, insurance for them, etc etc. Its not because ""They want everything handed to them"". They are doing Fast, fresh, and ferry-friendly.
My wife and I were craving oysters but had a ferry to catch in about 40 minutes. The team at Elliott’s sat us at the oyster bar right away, got our half-dozen oysters out fast, and let us settle the bill early so we could head out as soon as we finished.

7,The 5 Point Cafe,"Tried this place for the first time back in 2019 when I first visited Seattle. Tried it again this past weekend and it was just as good as I remembered it. The service was great and we got seated immediately. The food was very good. It is a little pricey but still so good. Highly recommend it!We ate breakfast here twice during our extended weekend (why are there so few breakfast spots in Seattle!) and absolutely loved it. Food was great with huge portions (we never came close to finishing). The chorizo is amazing, great taste and not greasy. The French toast my daughter had was so good. The food at The 5 Point Café was incredible—everything we tried was packed with flavor, and the portions were perfect. The staff were quick, friendly, and really on top of things even when it was busy. I was only in Seattle for three nights and ended up eating dinner here twice, which says a lot. ThAtmosphere is very Seattle.  The highlight for us was the food.  We got cheese curds ( being from right by the Wisconsin border we know cheese curds). And they were really good!  The sauce that came with them was delicious! Different from what you might find in the Midwest.   My kids loved their macWe tried this place recently and I wouldn’t recommend it.

9,The Crab Pot Seattle,"Visited family in Seattle on a Sunday and this place was the only one that was left open in tourist area until 9 PM.

It did not disappoint in having really good seafood. The portions were generous, and the staff is really nice. My dad is handicapped and they made sure to get us a good table for himWe had high hopes for The Crab Pot and spent around $200 for our visit. The service was truly excellent. Warm, attentive, and welcoming from start to finish. Unfortunately, the food didn’t quite live up to the experience.

They did such a great job with the interior, and the atmosphere was great too. I’d love to come back again!☺️💚💙This is my favorite cafe. Don’t come for a quick cup though, instead be ready to take time to enjoy it.This review was about sustainability!

I was so happy to see your intention and attention when it comes to reusable ware for your customer customers.

From the real mugs, to the glass plates, to the metal silverware, to the refillable cups at the water station…beautiful :)

13,Bacco Cafe,"Went with high expectations but left somewhat disappointed. The Dungeness crab omelette had a noticeably strong fishy smell, though the flavor itself was pleasant. Overall, the food tended to be on the saltier side, and the coffee was underwhelming.

One thing to note — there’s an extra tax for usinAs a huge lover of brunch, I can say that Bacco completely satisfied my cravings! Let's start with the juices: the Verona and Modena were so fresh and sweet they set a new standard for me. We ordered the Salmon Benedict and the Salmon Omelette to share, and they were both fantastic. The Belgian waffSo impressed by this place! Was staying at a hotel nearby and was sat outside right away. The strawberry orange mimosa was delicious. The highlight meal was the French toast which absolutely blew my mind. My partner also liked the crab sandwich!Cute place. We went here for breakfast and they seated us very quickly. There’s more seating outside behind the restaurant and it’s such a nice area. Food was solid and wait staff was fine.This place doesn’t accept online reservations, and has a line system in front of the restaurant. We went on Sunday at 11 am and were seated instantly. The place is big and takes up almost the entire block on one side so it’s spacious.

the baristas are chill, and if you avoid peak tourist hours you'll wait no longer than a couple minutes for your coffee.

if yoI went here to get my latte fix. It took a while for me to find it. When I got there, there were only 5 people in front of me. So I got my latte and I was quite disappointed. There was no coffee taste. I expected more from this edgy café. The price was also quite steep, $7.17 (incl. tax) for a tasteMy group had various lattes. All were amazing. It is a fun atmosphere. I have had coffee many places in Pikes Place. Ghost Alley does not disappoint. Put it on your to do list.Feeling pretty neutral towards the coffee. Ordered an ice latte. Hope that the coffee can be more full bodied and aromatic. Taste wise, can be stronger.Such a cool vibe! Friendly staff and strong coffee drinks. The mystery mocha was so fun! Strongly recommend Pike’s Place Market goers stop here for coffee 😍","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.7, 'energy': 0.7, 'elegance': 0.3, 'authenticity': 0.6}",0.8,"1499 Post Alley, Seattle, WA 98101, USA",,5,"[{'height': 2996, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111817914808158211461"">Han Kim</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4p1kvUXoZIyVPqGB3Zcv4zus8wQJLQQ8reFEk4YtoVeDissmvwacUOFuzK0HBoXQg6SWCbR4qI6go1sPZnjqO8q9ultovE1R8-t4IkeLiWVt7IHX3FEDXABZ0HXYzu7sGtoGMyrAMgOHX0n6dD4iPxSDbetpj6dlSu-XYJiRlCiYtp18ewEPp7tfMwGVv4IKn1apZWP4-VEhuRmijAdwJuatNLUGYjwClr_tqLn7kVSgwJtHr3Fc8VbpEd5OqoKeQwKRzoVX7sPgfesGFxpWBpBDD4sGw4LY3VnGrLcA_f2ISr0norl93-44wiB0M-UWN6-XiRBnDin1GuXug5IRvAdTO9sHWkZTqIC7ZBVEzGgrrXFdk-QNCOs5_gTzQv4apGai9In9tw2BoBT0-PJeegW78tSzmF4BXHIkOyM2ekqg', 'width': 3979}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112981185373316391574"">Alexis Student</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7sPFeguFG79tW1XPbXHE6wOM0YuJH4fl2f2Fc8GO6urTlicU4n3W_Q7zZh7tVL3AlkleCBj8RJ7i8Oro4O4ORG-0ibJqUlVBMwmsCdd5ca67Z6IXfQa4Jh3BkNzG9LCTHRa_NCSwKm2plMyz0muITkA1Des-uIzCSkBYqplVtn2h8qo2K1qehZHnOcvdKnCigwZxyln1IpbglgLAIL5-SWzSW9_ntAU8z7_ncBtxYOunOGSko34l334u37s6ZvOSVQYOQ-2qZaBzv_qjeTG63IxFP4PNnbh8ZU-Xsz0leIc_gEx_VlGcjvYIpEUQ1QzqAAsWefQlqmieWm79KD0RH_xUOpkaE2hf6ENx3uOQrPnjK4LBI5gLFwdWaq-0S2LwGB6gStK0IhcX4qXpnMUxFzChG5Drr-DxK-Wgrf2EOjyL9l15EwTwSF61GXYMdP', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116639652154121410882"">Lily Chien</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU51fBh-tl3dmjvst-ulrOzUUBWqhxtr2TPn69KynMZOEpLpPbAVvfGIbL86K9q2JD3tMb4suFmW3t70enHl8f_9SoLx4OpfZzBZlCPfdyoS8zs4qggjingUtsci8VABx8FvFPsYDidgHR4d8qJM6c4wOjXZTTDWT0VUvrqIJdrucbtflzXDHMe_le5wB03bddnzBkE4OitXpR-iaP34e-DzLvaQ_DPYQYGXmX08CDZwVCfkPZ6pIVpXKFw3re-NPryMry0Aq17zw-Eg1FUwjt_BzW3qHDwRj9EENa3zmla80JKOezp8FQJK6uBu8tIvk8MJ8Ph0az2pbEIwBPHmwCCYoS7Z9caJYU4G8ZXrWp_KRAcww2gKK0Kgl39aUEVRN9gKGqz5zxvo4QOQq4P0-Kh2NalrtfGqNSjCcMl5P_7rrw', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112445758592653498200"">Jonathan Morfin</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7PoTEEQac3-ToqBX8lZU1LeakviMimfgnk4Db9YYqFHV-DB54cl_z39u6QaKUdV-a9xeOpK8qvkr8sBQSkoyfrR3HRESUg0Q_KY-7SjSmK37xpjx9uXWZphH2gXJcE9T0_C7lS91rTT13xD39B30Dof27SJKfbslXETHBzPPzF5Ma6MeduI_Z8TkUVI7QxNX9ZubhdoJIoJ8rdmhgva6c6BfmNcBdWcKgYvnN5m8ZjOU0paRpIsOzN-NORzRzpeZZzhlPYMy8sDFqgKMyVJLANEO3qZo6bxmGBStx8j0b3_CAvYAHzOpNY1OmgeQADsmBtchTflE116g8J4q7bENZRVTn6Jk2A-kJumm00wkZ6jfgPkBSGwRfKONuE1-lvdRJHFrB1eH5cAe8WF_oooeVGqn1HprrZFf5R6ldCrC7g7A', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 4096, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111147679647020656845"">Andrew W</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4V1AghcTkhdPdmacohPVSu5ezK7-AJM4Sc3aWgieDQgTBswK2oklY3rIkEinBYUZeKm5OCGCUP-KEPmYECNos1C9v8D17RcbRees105ZnL9TDoefNwtaMKFYkcVLpP3rPKL0LOtmPo_Yog2DbbqGtBkDYJHocC3DXSOJI8fiKmYm_y5xCmSvrgxNjQ4ELj6BHrm9WFH82KIkKL7gjufbSUNH4iqLyDmX5ghrnJNqzLkmiQvdpl0kdZ_6eUVw8zoo6R-dyGtAk_JKdXKElT1oPpcb-FxdRERpaKtZtv7iBre_Dt7xUJcrsG9k4qmCbaTjbBV1EDS_VUicxwqJrgT3Q6-UesmSGRnajFtWd6S6AYiSmoPoKCPB46COemidFAZBLeOmV-aJZrv8VPtxZlP13jzRADQX7Go0G7cshuB4MikiWhSlNEK6EoRpszmdRl', 'width': 3072}]"
15,CU URBAN MARKET & CAFE,"What a fantastic spot for coffee. Unpretentious, yet high quality. The apple turnovers were terrific, the lattes were incredible! I only wish I found it earlier than the last day of my visit home to Seattle. Deft will visit next time I’m back in town!Had it one day, came back the next.

Best coffee we had in Seattle from 2 Aussies who love their coffee.

Great price point, friendly service and smooth and strong coffee that’s well balanced.

Love your work!This a chilled cafe. The price is very affordable and the coffee is excellent we actually visited here almost every day when we are in the town.I had their peanut butter flavor cream coffee and it tastes great. A good mix of creamy and not too much peanut butter. Overall atmosphere was calm and food selections were varied. A bit pricey but still a good amount of selections.Went on two separate occasions. Last week I tried their strawberry real fruit smoothie which was not overly sweet and just right. Texture was good.

Yesterday I went and got their iced purple sweet potato latte.

For anyone in the aThey serve some of the best coffee in Seattle, along with a great selection of snacks and sandwiches. The cookies are freshly baked and delicious. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Seating is limited, especially during the busy morning hours, so plan accordingly.Victrola Coffee Roasters on Pine Street is a true Seattle gem! The coffee is exceptional—rich, flavorful, and expertly crafted every time. Their selection of pastries and treats pairs perfectly with any drink. The café is spotless and well-maintained, making it a comfortable place to relax or catch The coffee was fantastic! Lots of syrup options, but only vanilla sugar free. Salted caramel hit the spot. Close to Pike Place. It was on the way to there from Westlake rail stop.So this spot consistently showed up in various blogs and I expected it to rock my world. Unfortunately it did not live up to anything I read or saw. It's ok. But in a world where there are so many options in this town, still not sure why people keep bringing it up as one of the best.","{'casualness': 0.7, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.6, 'authenticity': 0.8}",0.8,"108 Pine St, Seattle, WA 98101, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 3000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115613756678917847622"">Santiago Padilla</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5NGU2Je37h84nw0wdSPJPX8UnT56XMYUngoT-I8grGUuPbydwlzBUZY_lCqLWEc7s5WrKh4tEiqHQkp79uPUsdY-gqd0W9g4t2lArV51ENsyVhVM3kDT9LwxjO6m_Mu9IH04ZWG1kClhKd9v2sWeLrdlIdOeLqdR-xNIMsc6fyMaa0ej3EdJp1mgwO11TZ4cUT_8vJKGHKQZXdnaYYhCoo-ugKnCr-xd9Vd1MTtI25K5C04V00fs90CiY5tfU9RahWfZHWTA2s6kqdw_1rYTu-3fyKsHwgsaLktiuopTx36lPkdQVv_ZnpGXoFOpC9RbGnKpyXkBLbC51s-xrV_onZplZzxsaF6_DE9udP22zTQSJTMvLXpLWly_NcXoNr1LHfL4PSEXoXoMzgJhhG5L3fcPSsZP99nH69e_gaF-cTMUQC', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105877892124929952379"">Jon L</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4Op8KxsQzef0V5BQKIdPqHC2msAPhTAzflIvcGqPbskLjthZC2nd92A7sup0A0HCS9gCWp2MPnN7dgIMG7ZcwsjKVdL2WsOkwS3ZKMuRG78hHfN84bs_gUufU8KC1O8DtSaTkt5eC4EiNL8baqg-c_S3BOQqYKeLukNehTLTiZzwRybwBzFpbX1lduWTh7huwI3E8110noUwSNBqNmnyQsJsCCYpb7UEMrDk629BOlDxe2nR84fuYNKr48V3exYuTR-CIuzLuqHJOPYP0PrZEHe_Nh9tLrqrqJLlU_R58lVitCMkJY2HBf1B4HEnr4z2Zy8o8E5c5R8ehmM9eG20l1O4sjpv7YMQP8NxMNJ2WCo35dw1_jU5LSUusynn23i50ozSg-pBeqVP8dkZyU3WL6dINHXY47BBVe5xQU8iVfbXZt_I1o2FRDKuiO4T8k', 'width': 4047}, {'height': 1367, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114913467741000299233"">Victrola Coffee Roasters</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU670jfNiwd7ECKXtQYAkMflBt_2jeWABfXMhhMk8ienTS3TdOJaA0hHj0FarAI_H_ErNLiOe5HOefdB65YIlxrq8O-8eYATK3zGhZYU0gc6kr44tuDrg1RT4kvipl4onXUAFzS7QbmNLMnziRYcEOxUy0V1kdYkHXayoHClhcormaZzB2q3nFS68eaGUj1zJ-qjnrcUkyilTNC0X3aXxE979v2U-eH-uS1EyGoPyiCxaJ17T8jVnF_8aDuQGYClqiTnKMo2ovfEIcfnlGt6IAi85XDo3d7yJorrFYM7MVobog', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114913467741000299233"">Victrola Coffee Roasters</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU68MtyDbDEutuDeaSrJVTaap7smqK4pSlqJL7BHinCC8DIJ50bzP_OO9PnpFcvPqO-kXvyt7_msv1gNwcuGU_IScKP6dlLXTJn6Rt3U1tXXFZyWVUnQzIpT61CT3wAKD37dsMwWCX54I1X_cByQC8PQjDNKGJwGTW46QejtGWfhLvfmk7WUm51KJ9ZF2J2VisA0XHL0P-xlqUiQJ2_U2tYJZSxySm_gE1E02ArwmShZiqUVmuva6IvbLlClIjIDhCOQ7o6n7qwXngm0x4MkjjLmIPdvWL0CXjD31gruGPkidA', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/118349309117346129861"">N N</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4xKwCbX9GOa6Q23EPWVcra3rmnf3j10aDRZKUUx4CUv729xIKxgEt9jKoHMKEdVwVsq4UcAlVCMlQT2stFeEP98let-9wLTy88FblKaeJF1QiJBzjds6CKpA7C6JqE13y3hsfpdWvYNx9791q65d8UDEOmaRacV83tCng1WlOlbTLie3z0rMnVDKfkKYVPahXChLXQMJYb8vFMcyO_AVa_cgPrw7Hm_qbWV1tS1ZY5uwXrwjeDIMoa2bZToO0GEzjYJHmWchlmdTUoDoT3GJJCle710mTkkO6ZHrlvF_dPl9zFXrKgDN6GoH61BOJwvqq8gymzKFaqHjsfdbnP-XO_5EWv8dvqQgRcWOLmfhYM4pfkYV3ks6d9IzRzLg94btQA4xM-9lbbbY3ztYUV9FwTpfJgsp0eEwlSkh65yoPJJjyKTDvrSg', 'width': 2252}]"

18,Moore Coffee Shop,"Very cute coffee shop. They serve unique and fun drinks. Lots of options if you don’t want coffee. I loved the taro latte. They also have a great horchata coffee. The food also, is good. Waffles with guava were tasty. I will definitely come here again. Maybe on a weekday though. The weekend was packthis was our first stop after arriving in seattle for the first time! so cute and everything is pink in here. the boyfriend enjoyed a drip coffee and i got a horchata latte! we also got a cheese danish and it was so delicious. i love the cozy and intimate vibes!! would recommendA cute cafe with excellent non-coffee options! The ambiance is cozy and inviting, and the beverage presentation is absolutely stunning. The highlight for me was the Besame Mucho (definitely ask for your preferred sweetness level). Tres leches matcha is also a tasty beverage and comes with strawberriThis is a Latina-owned business, which is absolutely awesome and definitely worth championing.

I ordered the Café Madrid and loved it. Made with sweetened condensed milk, it is creamy, rich, and on the sweeter side but not overpoweringly sweet. Just the perfect balance of bold espresso and smooth sAdorable latte art and delicious mocha! Visited Moore Coffee in Seattle and got a mocha latte with the cutest bear face on top. Rich, smooth, and perfectly balanced.

The stools of the bar are super comfy!

We got an egg creme brulee coffee and a matcha pandan coffee.

I loved that they offered such unique coffees with such a clear and easy to This is such a fun spot to check out! Love that they have the flight option so you can try a little of everything.

Of the flights we tried, I love the egg brulee foam & taro/ube foam the most, it has the right flavor and compliments the matcha drink. Roasted sesame foam was good too but I feel likeHoly crap everything is amazing! I got a bao bun and a matcha flight and everything was so epically flavored and balanced. Nothing was too sweet and the bun was moist and flavorful (mushroom cashew mmmmm). The buns were gluten free too so my friend was able to indulge in one for herself!

Artwork was cool, vibes were immaculate 👌 there is no food on the menu but a coMy favorite neighborhood bar. a HUGE fan of low light, chandeliers and candles and the art covering the walls. Almost every cocktail I’ve had has been delightful and decently priced, can have about two rounds without feeling the sting of the bill.

Staff is super chill. Only complaint I have is whilWe had a great experience here in First Hill. This spot has a cool vibe with a creative cocktail list, a fabulous bartender (Fiona), and Seattle worthy music playing. There is also a collection of beautiful art on both walls.Visited in Aug 2023

A really great ‘hidden’ bar as the name suggests. My friends and I ended up visiting the place twice during our short stay in Seattle. Really loved the cocktails. My favourite cocktail was the “Seats Way Back” drink. Service was good.

21,Some Random Bar,"This bar became my go-to spot during my time in Seattle. The food was tasty, the drinks were spot on, and the staff were super friendly. My stay was short, but somehow I ended up here almost every day. Next time I’m back in Seattle, this will be one of the first places I visit again. Big thanks to eThey have 4 TVs and play NFL although the TV size is probably on 55” for 3 and smaller for the fourth. Just opens late.
The drink menu is great and the food is delicious and not just run of the mill bar food.
The clientele is not young and more laid back atmosphere and not loud.
Music is played so nWas staying in Seattle at VRBO for a couple days before getting on a cruise for Alaska. We were looking for a place for drinks within walking distance of the condo and stumbled on Some Random Bar. We liked the drink options on the menu so gave it a shot. We absolutely loved it, drinks were awesomeOverall had a good time here. I ordered the Italian style burger, and after a 6 day backpacking trip, it was delicious! As were the fries and beer.A fun spot for pre-gaming before a show. Their food menu appears to rotate seasonally, with some house favorite cocktails staying through the year.
Happy hour is a good deal, one of the surprisingly dangerous drinks that is a go to is their house margarita mixed with pina colada and toasted coconut.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.3, 'authenticity': 0.2}",0.9,"2604 1st Ave, Seattle, WA 98121, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 3614, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114163547900788402210"">Thomas Thompson, MD, PhD</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU74A_b8g8MDHjRJ-9OtEtU09V1l0bct-2AtAomZh4fzvsxx9QYUSuRA0vM_dVTmhK8PpDszo0opEob2DGgjrDLhSm4Jz4qA09_WqkShqfw8vV2FLU0djFrdHJUMhyg7OYHs3CCoiD8Oico7xzgYU_CxGLF4cLeUVSx19HIEkxJbCkroWwT_vv3kKf4vHO0VFKzBDa3WNcW3V0NzfZOeOTr8VZmjRJqcvgx7s4gbr-pPuCq38v0VYozPvS5150WxEjTcr2HIY_VAyYRh3uIRPRNrqS1hZDP3-SP6oBnWIKrIB9viuH1CQd6SsEQPEl6TYZKQQ5dVdfR0dXnmxhDHteHsdVy5YM5BK0uVuCQ6nB4H16pKlCCRX73Msu3ok-IyYdRQhVc4TKNNVBlh1Tj4xksxjTMSgBriOySJg58aEzJo5bjFA7BoiHEdg8wB0A', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112624033770292806468"">Stewart Lawson</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6CDMfjLVdN-UZmOa0hwtgbvWg7W-cl8u7hXuvgVUpFsEgHHRW8k51skguwmyW295Jko039dbMcwrC3qReUYqSbrJatfWcKoKN83VHQt7JNtkDtc0HvX18NyIDH1Gjrn8Pz1F0KMrPb-mQGkybMeaYmG-Ia-dKRWpqO1EfZwnuN_Wiz26EcMerX-ZPh8OI-ghaV44f1lJWzNPmpRwbPuvUg_lN9ze08FApNmXeYhRu4p5EPOxAkmNx_N82qrLEw7azBqSvci7RbBmP5j-0T_D81wL-MjEnuQwLpq8Y-gr7Tx6VnmfAjiGxx97Zs07bZAKrrO2231692hXdxaXw5mDi1wsEsI_voyyxetsZxmozQvBTcKps_925s5UGDs8E5J9rbXixpxPE5G_ukdCh8-XMMf5EMWf5KvU4gvs86gNMss0Ed', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/118417407752228020422"">Christy Sykes</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU666R7HJcJFhKCeO0uiQGbSQRCAtUaQR8u67H2q66RvG0ce4hGkJZJx69b-87p3N326rfC4rNQsDLS2tp8tpTVY2fWqVJCKmPqG1CdSfXJ2mzQw9UKms2ckjvA4Q37-6OxGxHwxyjfMRAgXmKaxBtVGbreatGzVkiiPoweA6eXtNtaWp5enngRYH9UkKc5lnWNQO0nwkxbxzEHYRySURGvRmgG1_-1ueTJmmBwtNuULMqpApGSBdv1uCap_sZDY67-PT1K-jfj5dXZvKQ5zJYEmSvx8r05JiRzNscy21i7m12gsDlufvsKpW3P5hLu9uy_9eDKlh_iYn3MU-1pLMYjsxiy_U35rLgqawXtIGLAG9IgqW_tCdTQWo8cPVFFs6_Zo03WwdBAqwbS8o6NTzC1a7F3xhf0Rk3Udsi9Yx3C1dWbqFe5gVYHzjP-sRMWy', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/108422636728547239202"">Yogi Donovan</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7smYTgNpiNeZUWSvPVjl_CH0225Kam2B-7JriXg6EtFKmlYyXyvA0JJ1ApStuNcyRAj13qCkAlyUO2gf1MXFRnI_MCXsRLZaFO_AdiGoZGEQ_RlIr08M3JYm-DoqG1raP0STKtpVdoUytgjVf3CXgFhAxpPSmU7612RnJVkK7PcYDLNTq5yg118ELy40Jm8hJx8IS2YvrKO1m2qGYezufC_XgodIlZPMthA1Xrshi8HX2Mg0xDsKOfkSDjDFSIkxZwxGJwt-q4jrT7MH-uC3zQ2uK3ydJuaDNqL_ZwHL9uaXJH0d6cMwoWiBc84wCKsMVjxeNxytYxgc7U3f79ARUxDSlH4Qsdd3cXTWwtdQHBTIRPo_k-Me-8xz_t9xVTva-zeruDoekhC-pczi4J1LQP9vtKPy2aZvWEM1TwJOMVgw', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102328204937283994743"">usshi ushi</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6q2Rz7OgvimBtrydK7V5-fc6USoCq3VGpo70MMk8JJFabWTTrPVKaIJI8_18g1NURk89lzkkHW6VAQr-M6xXtRfoowPrXyfPRutjlkJPOKxzSRy3bVc5Pdw5lPglVaLeQiyE3Wjp0Txtdvy4eZqObXLA7elKIfZfxSfnCcW6-fsy0nb_0pJ1i2nkfu96dOjNEZ8tno_yfHWOFiRtVXuW0QhFvmhBUHhLl6SMpjPkN8NfKdEDHPIRwEhJXNg_SHaEQh9QQnph4TkjFiwmS0XM5mvhUY_SJ-Fz13iv2qYIFudmMN89ub2tdivxQND9bZ_pyDVAk7FM08SFplj20A8PMXWPuDWLGDTY1Mur0esWve2rbG5fVfEUJCEdTf3pN3J_1Z3I0uiB7-mshpeIOnPigEcOUOCvQS2Yc1Nk07QEMu11lFJ1SvW3DjomjfdQ', 'width': 4800}]"

Turned out to be a pretty sick dive bar. Lots of arcade games options out here. Definitely played lots of games. You can exchange dollar bills for quarter coins and play arcade games. Pretty cool spot to hangout during late evenings. The cocktail options are limited buReally great bar that embodies the Belltown nightlife. You can hit the arcade in the back or fill up on some Good Shape Pizza in the front. The bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. This bar has great energy and I absolutely reccomend this one.Great customer service!
I had a billing issue during my visit to Jupiter Bar — I was accidentally charged more than I ordered. But when I reached out, the staff handled it quickly and professionally, and they refunded the money without any hassle.

The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly.  The cocktails were all delicious, and would order any of them again.

The piIt's a pretty cool place located on the second floor in the Pike Street marketplace. They have a great selection of rare bourbons and some tasty snacks.  We had the baked fontana and some tots loaded with a fried egg, gravy, and pulled pork. The snack was nice and hearty. We also had their smoked olWhiskey Sour with Maker’s blend was incredible..Bartenders are all so sweet!!
We work in food industry and they gave us industry discount as well..🫶💕😘🥰😍💞We also got Mushrooms as our appetizer, Beef Short ribs as our main course, and lastly to pair with the crazy deep fried Bread pudding which is outWe ordered the 1/2 pig head a week in advance. 7 of us at the table, 6 from Hawaii, that poor pig did have a chance. Deep fried ears, lots of meat and the nephew ate the eye ball for a free shot of whiskey. We drank and had a great time. We will be back.Radiator Whiskey: A Seattle Gem Worth the Splurge

As someone involved in the service industry for years it was very impressive, as was the quality of our cocktails. Fantastic, friendly service in a great atmosphere. Dillards is a great bar. It’s cozy and private. My husband and I came for a few drinks and we had the pleasure of having Corey be our bartender. He made all the drinks with care. They all came out so tasty.

We also really loved the hand cut fries, we couldn’t decide on 1 so we tried all 3 - so delicious! Thanks for having us!I'm not sure how to review this situation.

29,The Lookout,"Went here specifically to review the place. Showed up in time for sunset and sat on the patio. The view is breathtaking and the outdoor vibe is cool, laid back and friendly.
The service was kind but infrequent. The crinkle cut fries were actually really good!Nice vibes, good service, and a decent selection. Cool spot for views if the weather is right and there's a seat outside.Love the firepit on the back patio. My  dog and I enjoyed the view. The cocktails were great! The bartender makes a really tasty cosmo. He used Contreau liquour for the orange flavor in the drink and it tasted outstanding. (Most bars use Triple Sec liquour for the orange flavor in a cosmo.)  The NY Lovely beer selection and great patio.

0,Buttermilk & Bourbon,"What a fun brunch spot! We have been to Boston several times, but never had the chance to eat here. Glad we did! The atmosphere is like no other. We were seated in the back room, blue light so it made for interesting photos. The service was phenomenal! Loved our server, she was so fun and friendly aPart of my friend group headed back before the rest of us, so we decided to stop in somewhere for dinner before we caught the train back. All of us were very glad we found the Buttermilk & Bourbon: a New Orleans style restaurant in Boston?? Yes, please.

Even though it was packed, we managed to get Decent southern comfort food. I liked the fried chicken waffle place for brunch. The beignets are amazing, flaky. The atmosphere wasn't great though. The service was also slow, it seems like they were understaffed. We waited for a long time to get out check (after asking for it for 3 times).One of very few restaurants where the ambience, service, and food are all top tier and incredible. We tried the BBQ shrimp, Mac n cheese, chicken sliders, and whipped ricotta. I truly have no other words than…wow. This place is a must must must for anyone looking for southern comfort food to heal thHaving been to this place a few times over the years, it has somehow gotten even better.
Their renowned biscuits are soft, sweet, buttery all on their own but when paired with either the smoked cinnamon butter to up the sweetness or the pimento cheese to provide more savoriness you cannot go wrong!

1,The Salty Pig,"During our time in Boston, we visited this place twice, and both times were fantastic. The Italian food is authentic and unforgettable.
On our first visit for dinner, it was a bit tricky to find a table, they had space but only offered seats at the bar, which isn’t ideal if you’re not into drinks.
OHad dinner here with my wife and we ordered the Chicken Piccata and a Margherita-style pizza. The Chicken Piccata was the highlight of the meal — the portion was generous, the chicken breast was tender and well-cooked, and the lemon-butter sauce with capers gave it a bright, tangy flavor that pairedI am Thrilled to find this Hidden Oasis of incredible food service & ambiance!

We ordered 3 meals for 5 people. We ordered the Polpette Sandwich (meatball), Salsiccia Pizza and the Bianco all very tasteful. Our favorite was the Bianco pizza!This resaurant is by the Copley pla e mall. Really nice vibe inside. Staff was super friendly. Love that they come with the bottle of wine and then serve you onbthe spot. Applaud themnfor that. Rhe meatballs with taiasted bread is a great app. But the Margherita & Bianco pizza were amazing.

Don’t know what spice or oil it was infused with, but I was impressed. Eggplant parmigiana was very delicately cooked to perfection.Great menu, everything you want out of a higher scale Italian place. Arancini had great balance in terms of richness and acid from the tomato sauce. Tomato sauce really stuck out in the short rib lasagna as well, portion well worth the price, great flavor. Gnocchi was unbelievably soft, definitely sI had a great meal here! The food is well-seasoned and cooked well. Definitely one of the better pasta restaurants I've been to. I'd come back!

3,Estella Restaurant,"Estella was a fantastic place for dinner in downtown Boston. We didn’t have a reservation but were welcomed regardless and were able to be seated immediately. The service from Rim was impeccable. She honestly made our night. She was so sweet and accommodating. One of the best servers I’ve had- and aWhere can I begin on talking about a place like this. With it being located in Boston’s Downtown Crossing the Estella Interior has a nice nighttime vibe to it. On to the food and drink I had, I first ordered the Strawberry Spritz which has an amazing sugary rush towards it’s taste. For my entrée I hI recently had my birthday dinner here with friends and the food is pretty good. Service is alright. Atmosphere is nice.

It took some time to order food after receiving our drinks. Half of the table received food while others had to wait some time. And we had to ask someone else to bring over utEnjoyable dinner experience!
We just arrived to Boston and walk into Estella without a reservation. The hostess was so sweet and was able to accomodate us! While taking us to our table, she described her favorite food.  We did took her advices and…glad we did. We ordered the candie brussel sprouts…oVisiting Boston on a Monday, we stopped in here. The ambiance is nice and dark. Our server was nice. The food came out quick. We tried the Rasta pasta with chicken which was great. The taste had a nice balance of spices. The burger was okay. The clam chowder needed a little something more.","{'casualness': 0.5, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.7, 'authenticity': 0.3}",0.7,"49 Temple Pl, Boston, MA 02111, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 1326, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107522296560945956887"">Estella Restaurant</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU595R0AciHoN91mckLiRIn6poKR127NlmmGfzvb9eOhZOQQTv_A3mb_YaDHN2RF2IXSVBUBTmZkm3FmxH0fRZAm0Al1RI3IZfjUU0uDldErc3UCzoQMhihzzB26benEIO49tuLitW7pt47YOWFyB6qG1ApPWk56j3OsuJ91WCWwWd8wQ2C2tGPQjRsk84GxP1UR1ni5sVTHbMTPVzaV_u-LrptrhKVDN6lNO8-mDSFDFli1vIW5RDXUZVTwPdCggW9AaS_p2oeB15bV0QgdLvLroUQOJF29PZqBhlSbtKQ', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 1366, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107522296560945956887"">Estella Restaurant</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7ogy4ta2qy2akdy6khwyccOVdTUjyKLHZ5ZQq-ZDdIgBSzw-BwpT9lMTKP8pHbfn9Ks3LN9ZwNI0M7RXakYWBIPsIBzw1Nc1Zi8iNPH16_oFvEOnCh6WXJmIhBWHcZLjQ3VNmFvfxsn_BILbWs0FbEJUG9wC_UrD1AUmtrcxosbJ_zvWa4MkzO4ZQkE-pG1_aAkOL33eoBb0t2mR0q3EnakCdiZfG4RJk2NqIfTEI0PTS2hLCXlJty0N98lVkxoSsFLpaps9aaYtVqHc66Eb9Ow_an31uBafzzTTp7ApI', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 1816, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104676560532291499062"">Tomas Tolentino</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6OFhGny1wyorGZwZzWbYQJV17l-MsolJ24jtv3rHA2Cbzm54xy6ymbWdEEGgKhlal6a-4NMiJhzaSb-owte3ysODECdgOOhwZQ4uL7z6Wiqzui_dwaMMfHwDGt7Lsj09vdrUTtGJUDGd9raiP0PAfeQKawr2Pcwd0U69qtc1v7n6oQz3WkkNou5L6NR-LGoR9JUaTose9Bop961WJltpoECx_55n34Af0kpRdfIEyBOY_DX77f1mX4RwlBSdMpf-VD97RGXdcnJNzdAhG8CQcsT2-e_ENqFtlbuJsbU3wYQA1EShmvYgvB9ctSNcmJ7DBgjA7TAVIrx7rV5wjetXMm7d87isuBdaZr6csOfgmFkiJX3Ne2NhVFAp5G59_nMlAUu1JhUbOJlpjVbI81rt8AcLrKRRqcNBiNbShdyLyGEU2Ya1YAnkIOSx5m2g', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117293018478126498768"">Eric Chiu</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7e8Q0sZEOKKWJbeD4ga8hjRNePRUZGL9zcKQbd8qLuQbIGs0NJ_t3Di3t51yyRXiZXfzjiSLRDYmO9eaIS4XsmEer_lZvSsSRsNJJJFUhVtI83TBG4Elt-kZqhYF_G63POw4rHz_XpWsOEDelXbeTrDlbhn0f3noXDXjkPKYADipNrTzcAQi_9eBuHfKSZJXRasiVDBd6RreBaVM4lnKim0_8khugBU56isf-xBGWfCtHJ5BXyb0q5D8-03HEyEmPsVadeLk7pJcgE6-qGjZSiU_bh-2s9Fmk7BJ4_squmm2knDs33W0sWkpEbHB4Sd5jihHQ4OWgwNtQsHuMxklFxhiTwAl0EtmlicBFpapiLQcxCkg-zJvxlohO21QLEnNXo-5kTATXANVKygehue5fxUe7MqXIrGwAYM0HAOb_cshBt', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/112937108249331001658"">Robyn Marie</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7Yz8tKBoWQnTjhNhTBfFQ_BW8fR0POaBc2a2lh5RLNqueC1dCHFMZt1bu9_9LEjVUIjRYSp-usnrE1lrawdCt185LyHRRDu2ZM_EJ1wpx6b8IfEcDs8amEKELkVm93erCWcnyhh1ysEqAVrZLPHTTvevg_fs7Niykn2uk-qg14wE8c0Od1iM3gBVdM1G29Q7KRsUmbXbzzsFVzg2wS03DI1G0oo3v7CnXvBw6t7r2PU3ug4HVM3KzBmqsiJRpy0aoekXL_kMcvPefYBUVaUcXZC6B_-EDdoW55aqsRKjMt9ktURu3lgJtrtGuyicay2BRCAPUJNM3wDSshb8MFG-d1ZguL8VwKAgBm6ZhvimbJKaVilzzWhZxaLllA_JGq4tU0R3lfY84yOJg2cZdN4Ftr9E5h540V4p2MgsCTDHx2FHc', 'width': 3024}]"

I really enjoyed my meal. However, I do think the service could have been better. It wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great either.
4.5 out of 5! Which is still great!Started our dinner off with some drinks, our server Mike (who was amazing!!) recommended the Beatnik which I absolutely loved. I would come back for just that drink. I had the lobster gnocchi which was a great portion size and was pretty yum ! Overall had a great time, just didn’t love how close togI LOVED this place! The service here is fantastic, the food is delicious and the ambiance is beautiful. Our waitress was great. Also, Shout out to the lovely hostess who used her phone's flashlight as I was taking a photo with my boyfriend, she's awesome!The food is pretty average. In vibes are pretty cool. Unfortunately we did not have the best experience they sat us for party of 10 for a table that wood be a tight squeeze for 8. Our waiter did not seem overly interested in waiting so that was kinda odd. I’m sure we just went on an off nightPretty, pretty, pretty good!

9,Saltie Girl,"Saltie Girl completely lived up to the hype. The lobster roll was buttery and perfectly balanced; One of the best I’ve ever had. The oysters were incredibly fresh and paired with great sauces. The atmosphere is lively but intimate, making it a perfect spot for seafood lovers. Service was attentive, Saltie girl was packed when we went, but we had a reservation so we didn’t have to wait. We were seated inside—patio seating didn’t seem to be available for reservations. The atmosphere was lively, though a little too crowded to have an easy conversation. The food, however, was really good and beautExcellent staff, great menu with seafood focus with classics and specials, lovely ambience. We went to dinner both times but would recommend making a reservation unless you have a small party of 2 and you might be lucky with bar seating. I think their drink menu is simple and delicious. Would recommThe fried lobster & waffles and oyster was perfect and the lobster roll was great but a little smaller compared to other restaurants. But the service was terrible. We were mostly ignored, all the tables around us that arrived after us got their food and finished it even before we got ours. We asked This place was bomb! We ordered one clam chowder for two people, lobster roll with caviar and tuna with pistachio. The clam chowder was sooo good but the lobster is by far the best one I have tried we got it hot, the bread was crunchy but soft and moist.

She also got This is an nice coffee shop located a short walk away from South Station. They offer a wide variety of specialty coffees and matcha options.

It just seemed tThe iced latte was quite bitter to my taste. The interior was nice, the staff were good. I recommend looking elsewhere to get your coffee but if no other options are around, this one is viable - iced latte became better as the ice meltedThe staff is friendly and takes our order efficiently. The latte with almond milk tastes good, the coffee tastes is not entirely covered by the almond flavor.

The seating area is small but there are plenty seats at the area, maybe grab one coffee and find a place to enjoy the city.The coffee with coconut was really special. Must try on your list! The snack was also tasty!

11,Madhouse Cafe,"Very cool spot! Drip coffee was smooth, but with a heavy caffeine kick. I tried the Tahini latte, unique and delicious. You can walk through the shop and check out bikes and the shop cat. Worth the special trip when coming through Boston, I’d be here all the time if I lived here. Don’t go in a hurryI came to this cafe with my sister, we got lemon pound cake, ice chai latte and hot latte. The drinks and food was great, great customer service and the cafe is quite enough to talk with friend or just do your work. I love cute interior design. Definitely would be coming back, next time I am in the Great coffee. Their specialty tahini latte isn't overly sweet, which I appreciated.

Unique shop with character. Highly recommend for coffee or bike lovers.

There is a high top table, bar seating, 4-5 small tables, and more patio tables outside. Good spot to get some work done, read or chat!I'm in the minority here where I had a bad experience.  Let's start with the good.   We came in here and the café looked awesome... you can get coffee AND watch people fix cool bikes and cars.

The earl grey latte caught my eye so that's what I ordered, large, I didn't say iced because I wanted hot Great code with a strong body, well balanced. In one week I went like 5 times and brought my friends to get a taste of local coffee shop.

12,Sip of Joy Café & Bakery,"I love going to this cafe, whether it’s to grab a quick coffee or sit in the window seats and work for a few hours. It is very calm and welcoming - a great quiet place to focus. Their coffee is amazing and they offer Turkish coffee as well as other creative drinks. I also like their food options likService are nice but I can’t believe after they warm it the food is still cold … what? :( The food quality is good tho. The latte is too much milk and taste like water but the black coffee definitely is good tho. Kinda sad :(. Turkish coffee is good but not great.If you're in Boston's South End and looking for a cozy spot that blends Turkish and American flavors, Sip of Joy Café & Bakery is a must-visit. Located at 661 Tremont Street, this family-run café, opened in July 2023 by owners Matt and Burju Sari, offers a warm and inviting atmosphere. ​

One of theA cozy corner of simple Turkish delights in South End.

While there are many Turkish bakery and coffee shops in Boston, South End and South Boston doesn’t have a lot of options. Sip of Joy filled this niche and brought a much-needed splash of Turkish goods to the neighborhood.

On my recent visit arVery lovely folks who work here and nice space, but if you’re a coffee snob who came for the high ratings just be a bit careful what you order.

The flat white here is a latte and the beans are not good. I think this is somewhere to go more for Turkish coffee or American-style syruped coffee.

14,Gracenote Coffee Boston,"Spent hours trying to figure out the best coffee spots to try while on my trip to Boston. This place came up a lot so I decided to give it a try.
I have to say it definitely does the job of waking you up. I was just kind of bummed out at the choices of coffee. As someone who likes trying seasonal / Definitely one of the top coffee brands in Boston. They’re doing really well, but if I could ask for more, I feel their espresso bean selection is a bit limited given their reputation. I hope they expand their medium-roast espresso options in the future. That said, aside from the beans, their presenThere is an art to espresso, coffee roasting… if you feel that way, go to Gracenote. They take it serious but are in no way pretentious.

The sandwiches are fresh and delicious, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend for both coffee lovers and anyone looking for a nice spot to relaxVery delicious almond croissant, super generous and decadent.

Greystone is a very popular small neighbourhood bakery near Boston Library. Had to queue for about 10mins on a Sunday morning before getting my almond croissant.

It’s on the bigger side for sure. Inside is a delicious almond paste filliPretty good coffee spot! Enjoyed their homemade vanilla flavor in the iced coffee, but the coffee was fine, nothing spectacular. The mixed berry scone was an amazing flavor, a little over baked so very hard outside but truly still a great treat.

It’s not a big place so limited seating and one big table to stand at and talk. Love the no laptops policy for most of the cafe. The cappuccino was not bad aI stopped by this cafe while exploring new spots in the city (though I don’t live here). It’s a cute place, though on the smaller side with limited seating.

The service was friendly and professional, and we didn’t have to wait too long (around 15 minutes on a busy afternoon).

We lucked out with a seat on the tFound this cute cafe while roaming the Boston streets. It's a must visit for FRIENDS fans.
The ambience is so great with lots of references to the show.
Our barista was amazing (unfortunately I didn't get her name!) and took the time to talk to us about the season specials.
The coffees tasted great Had a great time here with the moist maker, I mean the sandwich btw. Now the atmosphere was very chill. You can relax for hours. It’s cool to see friends references everywhere from the WiFi password to the menus. It’s fun if you’re a fan. Worth a visitFrom the barista to the random lady, all were very welcoming. From food suggestions and recommendations to random acts of kindness like wanting to take our picture for us.

18,Koko Coffee,"This is such a great resting spot!

My friends and I ordered some sandwiches, pastries and beverages.

We all loved the almond croissant! My iced tea was super refreshing for a hot summer day!I actually had an interesting time while I was waiting for another event to start. I ordered a drip coffee ☕, which someone else grabbed, a chocolate croissant 🥐 and I tried a French Madeleine, which had a lemon 🍋 flavor. My coffee was quickly remade. Everything tasted good 👍 and there was a lot of Pretty good coffee and treats, but not anything that special.

The latte flavors were hit or miss, but the coffee and espresso are good quality! I like their roasting flavors like the blonde batter, but others you can barely taste.

The croissants are pretty nice, especially the pistachio one which Food and drink are good, but not very special. Good location for a quick meal if you are around and don’t want to wait for too long. I would give 120/100 only because the matcha latte is not sweet. Finally a normal drink without sugar.

味道中等，饮料不甜，加大分.I recently visited Koko Coffee at 255 State Street in Boston, and it was a delightful experience.  This cozy café, located near the New England Aquarium, offers a charming atmosphere with a European flair.

I love books so it's such a great place to relax, enjoy delicious food and drinks and being surrounded by book!
Easy to order with QR code and food delivery to the table. There was a couple items didn't show We had a late breakfast there on Saturday morning. The place was not over crowded but there was a lot of people between who was attending the food and who was looking for the right book to buy.
The saff was welcome and helpful.
The food is fresh made so expect to wait a little bit for your food to bStopped here on a whim and I gotta say. This place is super chill and charming. Tons of books , blind boxes, totebags, and other gifts. And on top of that you can get breakfast /coffee/drinks??? This place is amazing.

20,The Tam,"Awesome experience here, just enough chill and spunk to fully appreciate the experience. The bartenders were AWESOME and had some good banter with them. Would come back again 100% if I lived in Boston!What a great dive bar. Awesome vibe and welcoming atmosphere. Can be a regular here for sure!  They don’t have a kitchen but you’re welcome to bring your own food in, do Uber Eats or grab a slice of NY pizza next door.Very tasty draft beer, I love the whirlpool hazy pale ale, excellent! Relaxing time .The drinks flow as cheap as they can,
The charm’s in the grit, not the glam.
Though the restroom’s a fright,

21,Extra Dirty Cocktail Club,"We attended an event that was designed around cocktails paired with food, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. The cocktails were truly exceptional—beautifully crafted, balanced in flavor, and presented with creativity. Each one felt unique, and you could tell a lot of thought went into tThis was a really good experience! You got four courses of cocktails paired with four courses of food. They're cocktail menu varies by the season. Currently it is their fall menu and the drinks are fall themed with spice, pumpkin, star anise, and new takes on old classics. A great experience and I lI took my 24 year old son who is a bartender for his birthday along with his girlfriend and my other son. What a wonderful experience from the speakeasy atmosphere, to the music vibe to the beautifully crafted cocktails and light fare. It was more than expected. The staff was wonderful, warm and graThe place is quaint. Nice music 🎶 you can have a conversation. If you like to drink this is a great deal. 4 cocktails of your choosing. They are all very thought out. Very balanced. The food is well planned but the limited kitchen space hurts the execution. From Texas I can say that the ribs were flThis was one of the best experiences you can have in Boston. It is a well tailored drink menu that changes every month with food to accompany it. The staff takes you along this journey.","{'casualness': 0.3, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.7, 'elegance': 0.95, 'authenticity': 0.8}",0.95,"326b Commercial St, Boston, MA 02109, USA",,5,"[{'height': 1366, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100357903657584843499"">Extra Dirty Cocktail Club</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5xgAPZz18O0yFCAguCXFfyIKtF7KuGo-nvZ9BpuZ304WPMBtRMwB8aFq7yrNKo7M3XFIZTi4G6EMzatumodX7Tj97cfyPbJYVIapv7HSILOK5Md_u_EnbA8-wJTIOPHmp00Rwr6whhWZolrujN7ANaqGzOKD8YbeIn1zs05dTR719Camt9jUSlNUrgTfZ9gRNVIhJCUtXiUYlwlKWUZWrJtdmFVV_-XabpTX-tpBBB9475HoBqAdyUphkN0WYjRdhqv3LAM27VpAaow5KUEhgIkA9MRP-e2ocFeWstDtZWig', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 1366, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100357903657584843499"">Extra Dirty Cocktail Club</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5QELrfWXd6zgkTpRelwr1KWd_wBJHquWV3AloYLHIGLxNTDcAA-b_KJBt3NHrA4f6caBvt5Sl0jne6dpXLPySrDeex01m8VkKkRNxDQ06lEsFmNl7aox1O4Ary6rvkQuJb42LAMaRcNE_LwQwKXTmoChKt0cUeO78HmLuSgrTJL89OX5LXBeIhMr2I_FK38-TuxA7ruxQdGdq0EtR0Fjg1V8gJKHVTCQba77J9qQCV_aOKM-8FIysfVJZsCyOkf2MvF-rXNYkqQ8EFuibEGfwcgohLcCaPY2_pKZyPmkoyOw', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106002032751684974019"">Caroline Dunn</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6PRglTE7F4QF5uRU0GO780DJuWd4YWETW98RED75Peu0Nnwn91FTBDVEryi6jmffQygqGsX_G5Mbkaol4KlGQW0GOzHPvkoYEfHKSlEWHatD5xHzPj8ADiMUa2iDZU7bG8dmDzOQCFsfUN882v6HK_WKQay850XxeOGrUGtpauEYv5nJYznE5mqvO7oZJ6sbVeEswIeaJgOOPysyVwaGSpK2ZE_Z6l6P4WjGA6ftSZ58tQ8D8xxdI98VpRbGIIXnqArY4fKrMRFV6eNOGIJBRrFv3lOXrrDsRlUQdgwidIGH6JI6_u9GUsqxQvU7VPd2-0bsvbCPZGoiSlAahjIF6W8wU69xSdRa4vKUy6Nt66FZk_q-v69z4HTI_XiCK6Pc3gG843G9RRSi50ci79hYwfsoyIAyKpIPbGhrKsmhPm161A', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 1366, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100357903657584843499"">Extra Dirty Cocktail Club</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU52Y993X3AvfL18sDCiX_JB4PN-gV17nLGXFPL9TsIMkdvIlL5-U1ZwYX4jLpz5fjbM5ORKgWonR6WV9F8GpjEuhtntPJ4XAC6XtQYWDeyCXAgDBoTO3atPvclurDtIB5hnVOcl-BlmwZues12asYJAebXhAevRDZqYGMk-b2lQC5mMX341P6kTsBmC76u7iwD8qM9bq29DkaUnWgslB4um_03EsZW7-1kF_0t22pt6khJd9cxuTdJ7ZjuWTD7W73x22XamfJ6TYQpnCwjUWjdNHKRpGoktFC9l3XGAuh7PfA', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107395845317286996729"">Alberto Treviño</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5MQhlekd191IZj-czdTlOgzZdfglu9JUiO-xZeU_vD29zwPCkL1Zg4vcrF45dMATsXq80z09cyFI75f4jbQkAgSTDWCfIUdNMUEfiSWwZUZE5hnUXe_qNcHbqUH77N2z-2T1xq2J9FIHEl0GH0BtUwoMR44ZLdiLaC3LDhrAQKBdxXTlg81RYQ1mU2lK32F6ycROJPspMbx7nxozo5gitb0cdAYZEALqgIhTzQDgnJNq4GhJ3SXekz6xD0KgVGD5ZOcXpgIJwp6AbuD3ApkZ_Flj-edjc62HpQbBNoec2JCn-84Hw5LpDIvyVLgaZF0aWwYhxtnkG3VBhCAO60_tsi5W-Eub0L9pVOH9GCgCHZOnI6pKxGS3vLcng_m_rqdqk5mEejLsLJbVa3uATkl8tTWON9QJKPKo2I1Vsof-CgnFeLXAQU7yyrj_jq1Rlo', 'width': 3024}]"
22,The Stratus - Rooftop Bar Boston,"Worth it for the views!
Cocktails are little on the sweeter side.
First-come first-serve seating.
Recommend visiting during the sunset 🫡We had an exceptional experience. The bar is sophisticated and employs real mixologists and skilled professionals. This is all to say before mentioning the views. I am surprised to see reviews that say this place isn't amazing, it's a must go when traveling in Boston in my opinionUnbeatable view and so cosy and Christmasy for a mulled wine 🎄 would love to see a few more vegan snacksCasy was unbelievable; the hospitality and service here are unreal. What an experience. I have been waiting quite sometime for this spot to open. A must for anyone visiting or even if you are from the Boston area!!! The cocktail selection is one of the best in Boston!!!!!!!! Get here!The bar was great, I hope there will be more non-alcoholic options too. Otherwise the atmosphere and whole experience was amazing.

23,Moon Bar,"Absolutely loved this place. Delicious Caribbean-inspired food that didn't hold back on spice or flavor. Simply superb cocktails made by professionals and outstanding service. It's a classy spot for adults to mingle and could totally see a great date night here.I loved the decor of this place! The wallpaper is amazing and it’s a nice, open, eclectic space! Their menu is pretty unique and has an island vibe. The Golden Colada was delicious and the Jamaican Beef Patty was a great snack (very spicy!) service was great, not sure it’s a spot I’d hit up for dinnEveryone was so nice and accommodating. The drinks and food were exquisite and vibrant. Best Jamaican Patty I’ve ever had. I’d go over and over just for that.We didn’t have any food but we tried some cocktails and they were well crafted. The space itself is gorgeous (photos attached).

There appears to be an inherent relaxation vibe in this joint. They want you to settle with your group when you get in, take your time with your drinks, and the service stSpicy drinks. Spicy food. Cute menu font. Low-key tropical vibes.

24,Carrie Nation Cocktail Club,"The cocktail menu is limited, but what we ordered was good. The appetisers were the highlight of the meal. Cannot pick a fave out of the patatas bravas, garlic broccolini or burrata with confit tomatoes. The service was great - our server Sophie was attentive without being intrusive. The atmosphere My name is Carrie and I approve of Carrie Nation!  We saw the window front while on a night tour of Boston and my girls decided that we needed to go, since their bestie is me, Carrie!  We popped into the lounge after finishing our tour of the Freedom Trail- pretty sure we were their first customers came here with one of my girlfriends for a drink. i ordered a cosmo and it wasn’t very good, i didn’t finish my drink. we got patatas bravas to share, they were pretty good and had chorizo. the wings were interesting flavor, im not sure id order again. we did see a mouse when we were sitting at the Carrie Nation Cocktail Club is a vibe! Love the decor & speakeasy atmosphere. We realized we were a bit underdressed once we sat at the bar, but didn't feel judged at all. The staff were very welcoming.

Manny was super helpful with me and my group made us all feel welcome, great vibes at this place and atmosphere! One of the best ""dive bars"" in Boston. good layout, live music, hospitality and bouncers all super nice.
Thanks for another greatI live about a 3 minute walk from this place. Lucky's is a fun place. They have a Comedy show and Trivia. I hadn't eaten there until a few weeks ago. The Calamari was good. I only eat Seafood and Poultry so I was surprised at the quality. Now..... Now... Ok, for, me, this place; I would frequent at Made a reservation for a table for drinks since it was an option, but turns out the host apparently didn’t come into work Saturday so there was no need for a reservation 😆

Regardless, had a really great experience. Bartender Rich was friendly and attentive. Singer was also really good.We went here for a night cap after visiting the holiday market in Seaport and ended up staying for 3 drinks!

26,89 Charles,"A new bar in Beacon Hill — I really love the vibe here! It’s super cozy and chill. 🩵
Drinks are great, and the food is surprisingly good too. The cookie was amazing! 🍪

Normally I’m not a big fan of bourbon, but the Fall Favors was a good one to try. This bar also has a lot of interesting drinks — IAs a Beacon Hill resident, this neighborhood needed a place like this. The space is the right amount of cozy and sexy. So perfect for yapping with your friends and enjoying DELICIOUS cocktails. Could not be more excited to go back and visit again. 💖✨This place is one of the best speakeasy bars I've ever seen. Bar is solid. Highly recommended!Great start to what can become an amazing cocktail spot! The decor and vibes are great. The space is small but not loud or overcrowded. Drinks were very well balanced. We came as walkins shortly after they opened on a thursday and waited about 40 mins so resys are definitely recommended .

Overall aWe happened upon here looking for a drink prior to a dinner reservation and im glad we did! The drinks were amazing, and atmosphere and service were all great! I loved the small cozy vibes.

27,Cheers,"It’s cheers what can you say? If you are visiting Boston and are a  Cheers show fan then this place is definitely for you. We did have to wait a little over an hour for a table in the original cheers bar.  The experience was definitely worth the wait. We were able to visit the gift shop while waitinUnfortunately not everybody knew my name but we still had a great visit... Staff was friendly as the place was packed.. beer glasses we're very cool and the beer in them was even better. We shared an appetizer sampler which had all the basic bar foods. Decent but not great.  Unfortunately the replicMy husband and I were so excited to experience ""the bar"" from Cheers! I was a little nervous as we had planned to stop mid-afternoon to miss the lunch rush, but plans went more quickly. We landed there right at noon. Going in, it seemed like a huge wait, but don't turn back! The place is huge! As a I really liked my experience here. Atmosphere was very cozy and cute. It looks just like the show, 2 bar areas to sit which is where we sat. Pretty busy place, but you can wait around while looking at gift shop which helps time go fast. I would go around opening at 11 am for quicker times.
Food was Super cool place! Amazing food! Atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic! Not handicap accessible, skip it if u are claustrophobic, tight, spiral steps to get upstairs to our seats...seniors in our group had a hard time walking up and down the stairs.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.6, 'energy': 0.8, 'elegance': 0.1, 'authenticity': 1.0}",0.9,"84 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02108, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 750, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111653539856883178329"">Cheers</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6FEr2gDDiEew5EzU1nUWx7V5p1WZNLPoLpZfHzVJlaCYaAIiVFrIpSeoH4pfFsOpPHTJtiZ4tXp-sFrNXg-0eT0xKlOsH0yA6up0YBn6k6sr-r6Jspc-HQgndQNAGhe4OZRwEO_fXC1KQCKWuvZRynu0_7vcpVYm4X3_n7CknY_UwJn91FBmL2pZEG-wwfW-jTqYWQbM7vPDUn9w4oUDnbbpNjxxWXXDegK1TWYFsPrLD8r0bFJO6hJUjQogwhAPt7pEBgBS3qbW4PfVBbB3x9rSJMxuByE6vWNHQCSLq91w', 'width': 750}, {'height': 1848, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102662911595221849765"">Ron Mosocco</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU71b4dqxM3NWqjJXY0H3KbghxFU2YjDtsgXpt3TrXOzUfmGqGnRPDvnigvlnsSpD_yjQ7VxVbtEq5GLUkC6gROR8_4p_qMvyJmjrZU_Y-WTs6P18_E5BoqE1CwozNNdOu_VZBcXwXaqLs_JWqJWt5uE4Ybfj2bbF1SDWHLqSF88kWotexJaAYAZg_H3Kive7PCUk3KLMxRsj2PYTSsTlTLcF4KxFqfsPNLNmdt5FJ8BeP1gXSb2NPDIutE2wLUmmqfW_HImxZfO_i6h2uS-9OYOGMIcRNv_e2e4nMu5F9SijWFFr8OkE5Z99NtTXLRdFelinwHtRutAk1js9td0cf0ihT64Zk1q_5tkkVSldIvP7Jtj2vYrhPag7ycZqyA0OwD-JnhgRdzMnEbQxcjgX820bJgA70AO84ggplZ9dvzsuFD94uY4AwUJCQXxaw', 'width': 4000}, {'height': 540, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111653539856883178329"">Cheers</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7aRga9nTWC8amMhLIlbMlwOPnUtkG79SpT-r_FKIQAp7egmAVczc3QBHvCfM5W2tJk9F0TFTzuM7j_rbNd2Q0QrvfF2iTdys56ABfpTL-QAG3cubK9U3lkIo-ycZ3XkJnhmbfI67NfxLou9cJ1hTfgNW_sNr9w0VXlDHOXAKHC_2-ppG5vF3MYtgRPRJGrP7kMkcYv-Q1B8Yn3gQJYyEeMHM6W02z71myZ1Dfw0q_CsxAF383lVIjOk4rvbBuepiHitbJSYJm_I_zRUJp7YJ0mN-lPwhFiggJ1UJ6T-JJJJw', 'width': 960}, {'height': 4000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113993596111279367691"">sherrie koone</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5D-kuOckQs5rjHW-tpCBCJzablgSAINXJ2mepksSO19mxpusRCYbXu6bdR1Lgr_axeNVHXq72Yb8jnt-Mt-EngeSu5Nr4Ub_LE69mehc-eH2yXIpG2NemZXn_6iKhon6wYmueGI4rXxlDm1UWLngpH0D2D8TVfAoUHfAXI4-fDnk-2bobgvTVGzEtgBulxKtW-e92Rp5FOecJ1Hy-_0rx7SRhAM1xn6YnBIsmSpIGgf-mdHKv26eqMbGevW53Zo3-WQtfmVjt9fQ6ZaF4kR58U-CQQOAiwussG5bhdx7dIZLLHiP56V3lhB23bQyTg1E56mNqgJYM5-9Mone_4hV9hC0QVThgZZpy_BLBFpVoW_jlwZ4dP4granjlgsACUEqSh6oBUbw1tF7qDIHjwpWdo6GENmJGcKgRif28aYJ6Mf3kyqQq75a18bFawG79S', 'width': 3000}, {'height': 1848, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102662911595221849765"">Ron Mosocco</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5pX__WZMXzZTzPsP1Vi2RYwZPUj1HrfNt6NIgS7YDXyZfc1DKujQDu29Mz8rMAXW_NO32niqBNpab7nyLfa-hJd9Ni6sLODueL5WZqGztvFwAj87VjVMKEtDRl0NPcfLqunD1iZ_laJLOoad-NJ1Q__Hqyh2LzOGxo1ygBV_LXNLHRMz_gDNYq5uGQReBwEqQ0CE9mMugOdqmKe2IK6ExcujCpg1twpsaLMi0XV6EY0NL4pEmwMeC5EzpJ4e7h4GSxibIXXrgcC7aBskqjWCkXcfWH-9_2pnsN2CfjzAlo946msHH5xLzguuPg0IPF8o4O7jwmYB3TQ7zVKrVrBgwhdk5bYI08SPb6fiKfyzA2ZzOs0KmQHIiuhSO6S-DHr8MSbdzmDzONO_o7jQzXT3zzVwExLVTjwg2vYjNynC83TLS1o7P67EVT5j6uwRz8', 'width': 4000}]"
28,The Greatest Bar,"Went to the Survivor watch party and had dinner at the bar while there. To start, we have never been The Greatest Bar, so I’m just rating this on the Survivor portion of the place.

The menu was pretty cool and themed very well for the event. Wife got the tacos and I got the burger. The bartenders wAustin is hands down the most epic server ever! From the moment we sat down, he had the best energy — friendly, funny, and so on top of everything. He made the whole night feel effortless and genuinely fun. You can tell he actually enjoys what he does, and it completely rubs off on everyone around hThe Greatest Jumbo Wings, Mushroom Swiss Burger, and California BLT.

29,Spy Bar,"Dropped by Spybar for some after-dinner drinks and loved the overall vibe. My partner really enjoyed the Lime Wire, and I went for the honey-based cocktail — fantastic! The atmosphere was perfect for a relaxed night out, with soothing music at just the right volume so you can chat comfortably.

The Spy Bar is such a hidden gem! It’s located right near Cosmica, and once you step inside, it really gives off a cool speakeasy vibe; with its chill lighting, great atmosphere, and an inviting energy. I went on a Friday night, and they had a live DJ playing smooth, laid-back tracks that set the mood pI love the decor and the live music.  The place is perfect size and has extremely clean modern bathrooms. This is a place for late night vibes for drinks and small plates. Short rib tacos are amazing.

My waitress could have been better. She forgot a drink order, and on the bill already pre selectedCame here for drinks and dessert. The food was okay and the drinks were unique. It gives off a 70s vibe with a disco ball, dim lighting and a great dj spinning some classics. Will come again, for only drinks and the vibe.Absolutely love this place! It's really quite an experience to walk into a place that has been thoughtfully created around the acoustics.

This is a pic of the spicy tuna bruschetta. It was such a creative, unusual mix of flavors. My taste buds enjoyed every bite of my meal!Jaimee was an awesome and welcoming server. She made us feel like she cared about our experience. The French onion soup was awesome (see photo). They gladly honored my request for my salmon cooked rare and it came out very good. The key lime pie was delicious. Highly recommended and great to find inAbsolutely amazing experience at Corinne in Denver! From the moment we sat down, the service was top-notch. Our waiter didn’t just take our order—he walked us through some of his favorite dishes, explaining where they were sourced and how the flavors came together.

I went with the steak and eggs, wI was very pleasantly surprised by my experience at Corinne. I knew it was attached to a hotel (Le Meridien) and I’d ordinarily venture towards an independent cafe for breakfast.
The ambiance was calming and relaxing. My server Mauricio was so kind and made me feel so welcome. All of the staff were Awesome place for our anniversary dinner.

They remembered it was our anniversary celebration and offered congratulations and complements multiple times. Our waitress kepEvery dish was beautifully carved and delicious. Chef Eden is creating  tasty dishes that are Michelin star caliber. The service and atmosphere was so romantic. We highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.

2,Mercantile,"Where do ya start? This place was top notch.
Tried the lunch prefix menu
That comes with a starter and an entree for $35...
Tried the autumn brussels and the broccoli caesar. Both did not miss. Perfect amounts of acidity on the brussels!

Main course did the millers chicken and the kewpie burger.

TWe were here for the happy hour while in Denver one afternoon. It’s located inside Union station. We sat at the bar and got the Mercantile High-five, a couple non alcoholic beet mocktails along with the peach and arugula salad. Everything was delicious! Our server was wonderful. Their menu options fLoved this place. Food was fantastic- loved the eggplant, the octopus was tender, the endive salad was delish. I did not love the risotto - I found the corn added too much sweetness. (I have less sweet and salt tolerance than the average person). The bread basket of Hawaiian buns was also perfect! WI visited during lunch time on a weekday to take a customer out to lunch. As it was a business meal I was looking for a place where a conversation is possible, food is good, ambiance is nice, and service leaves nothing to desire. I am glad I landed on Mercantile.

First off, the ambiance is perfect The wife and I were celebrating 21st wedding anniversary.  We sat at the counter and had 4 courses served  by the manager.  The GM popped by to say hi as well.  I was very impressed, black cod was incredible,  gnocchi fluffy as a cloud.  We did order the wine pairing and that was a great compliment.","{'casualness': 0.4, 'comfort': 0.8, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.9, 'authenticity': 0.1}",0.9,"1701 Wynkoop St #155, Denver, CO 80202, USA",3.0,5,"[{'height': 1366, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109086849787792915012"">Mercantile</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4-FHaW-P30Zx7QATYxZUmoKn9VyQlwmqWDKA8zrLbxmvhPjUTghBxTg7I303oS7jfU8q3UOq0HtXbckfop1k5_BJXEALKEHDCoM44eq0hFs4T2xvgVQPRzvr9J2osMBK-JjBziFp1MF1zxkgBmKPfeDKgcfga0L6XztOPKXb_hp0TGbaZ8Ubm6SNR2_UoLNk9puq6Cj-I6dCtnJ0tibinB_CN7TPrQiqfjr2rO9cAy8WNTGAsuXqghaTebRJ45mOcTLwJQSCCehaZuoBCKTJPmvwQYY6Au_Rs_Ok8zzh4Mvw', 'width': 2048}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114170890119862551939"">Raina Olivera</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6eHuEZiVIr-pw2GHY108fpOdIWlnq-0mMcm8lLgeHAbFA4IUgWjGOxPM3EJ01QOy9Bk-fz781IpcNQN180wmV8ra6kOMeRbQCvm-ot5vYX8w7LrA6sV5At7J2QNnIoyerv9DiRy1imUxmH_X8gKbENpHrCweyTVCTKU4ydayVplD5ZaPn2C9nx0XVsRdzdcR37_k6y-lAZbzaAlbJOM7tJJZo9a3TYDFN8ChFWhYiZtfqkHzLTzogHyWbCdESxJUczpLiOfgjc7VBkGDBO-ZPfG56VbstCD2hL6YuNq3hbg0vO2BsPOFmLqi7KJ8YVBWcp3ut2sM8aesDryWcvRY8yhsavSvFq8VEOaidBGkdY7sU5K-7JlEDTbqdNOWkRsDz4TRfLLcmUYEaz__FYOkNg0kgbu4po2Rdy70tri5zCSW1RsgtRhC--eN7wxC-e', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 3488, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109086849787792915012"">Mercantile</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU459EFJTXKTSaEQ0rUMZ5IkEmh4kEcQoZKZWTAqa6vH3aeLsY_1FZloyh9N_xNe_ufr_mz9GCEeYXJEu1MWk0ok9FPraIs67kkqW3vbofbUo2KZ3ZbYq7arZyINqsQZlSw7j1xgssxPuExu_a0fWUlqNl-30GOjVojAmtLwXStA11Q7H--l7OD1hBBHfuAVxPLWT5AfpfDYS-cQZ0yE9Ce6gHqwmcnSw-4lAzyj4xWQ8Ad3YKjct7N9rzfSxutQqClKMD94XfMGX6zYZ9D78EG9N8i-k0kkoYEfc4dJXExd0g', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 2252, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105967851803218441195"">Dan McDermott</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6ovhJ2ti67gg2gQP_ofXMSVjLSpeTU-2HuMY90EH7-NE3rL4KtzdoURdutF31l_Irgt7oeg8EIj2xtHUo3JyXDeB_B8ldfaNRKYiJA4fZp1elZxi5rCpUOe9FQuVe7rfGsZ63NsyDiA8c3fvmK_dUZBJLHoch0mIBp7SE_h-I2IYHVp24T59DjeiEF-0hIuRJzeGDKz4oqDhpCkAA6FLbBncxNBeQ5v45I9peQf4nowRviA_W5V-GBWGWE4fnDJChvQfju4yY5yrFLUj30LP4uRQsgH2gtCKb8wqbfyvQVZE0MaARDR6f46AB26Asnc674ZGPR2BX8SdFCdRCYXpFztMYRb44VRtzlQ0PZiDbL7Aueo4i29sN3JEtfCxqF1wtgVKTzBM2ZK2p-GJ_UsjmiN_QzBo8YCfd7Hwh4-2IUQ86zRKnvyYcmd81isA', 'width': 4000}, {'height': 2252, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105967851803218441195"">Dan McDermott</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5MNKxJcO-QSvMk34koGDzOb4lXdr38k8yYaH6Sw5It4pTc8sclLrKTF8BBrHN8U2Cbn0ZI2DHkNqxj77FbFep4gX3GQavrnPpxoKeGLAB0y8rFnEMPWQ_F-hqfu0WGqtNqIPgKPvWsYfwIfDzZUH39gUIYEkMRpvs9p16MTlCEmH4lndLKAFb_tfooi7c1e46SkTyLQchcidp0GVzd1Dpo48ugqveWaXK2F4bZP5pvXsaIBrcyKIG7cHRarE8FgB0iKKe125YFYNIi8AtY30YNF2MfO4dXneBOqdDetYDCGgNawz1wYsPmYUeuyTDACV8WlAzNcFooeFD1Occ7OrWlRChcwa4eppkQ78XO2fWboIf61IrjGJJifFo2I4D962VIu-W7DMdhBM0dAvMEeRSEXSvNNcinWro-CQA9oEhuTxjP84dp-XsQDdH1NyjZ', 'width': 4000}]"

To start we had the giant pretzel was so soft and salty, to my liking but others may find it too saGreat food, service and atmosphere! Convenient location right across from the convention center. 2 dollar shuck fridays for oysters what a hell of a deal. Super fresh and well worth it. Also the baked goat cheese spread was delicous along with the fried green tomatoes. You don't see those that oftenService was great. Food was amazing. I had the fish n chips, the Thai Calamari. It was brought to me hot and perfectly cooked. My local ipa was flat.One of the best American Cuisine spots on this side of Denver. Solid cocktails and equally solid food! We asked for a dish of Mac&Cheese to share along side our entrees and was sold after the first bite!

Both our entrees were fantastic and left no room for complaints🔥. I gave Service a “4 Star” purWe all had lunch here in between meetings. Everything was cooked to order and the service was absolutely fantastic.

9,ChoLon - Downtown,"Incredible food!! Drinks were delicious as well. Loved the bartender, Justin! Attentive and came with great recommendations. Also, the tamarind mule was refreshing and paired well with the food. The calamari is the best I've had, as well as the beef skewers. The peach leches dessert was refreshing aHad an absolutely wonderful happy hour experience here. My fiancé and I enjoyed the flights and bites. We chose well and enjoyed everything so much. Anthony took excellent care of us. We will definitely be coming back and we were happy for him to notify us of the new ish location near Sloan‘s Lake. Service was the highlight of this place! The food was great as well, but just a little too greasy for us.

If you’re debating on a few things, the fried rice is the way to go! That butter that comes with it is insane!!! So yummy!!!!

Soup dumplings is what they’re also known for, but I find that theIt’s been over 10 years since my last visit to ChoLon. My husband and I went for happy hour and we had 4 cocktails and 7 small dishes for $96, which was not too bad! The food overall is delicious. The French onion soup dumplings are very good. My only issue was with the fries that look and taste likLoved this restaurant!  We were here to walk around the 16th street mall after taking the train to Union Station.

10,Crema Coffee House,"This place, is DIFFERENT. I can tell that they care about being unique but also having such an encouraging and uplifting atmosphere. The espresso tasted very handcrafted, the cinnamon roll was incredible and the cortado my fiance got was very tasty! She loved it! More coffee shops should post obviouCentral market is this great space with several food and beverage vendors. Inside is Crema coffee. I came for the matcha on my matcha tour. I am only reviewing the matcha. The matcha was not my favorite. I had the ube matcha and to be honest I couldn’t taste the ube. It just tasted like plain old maGreat coffee brews and light bites. Sistainanle, inclusive, cool, and cheery. Def worth a stopMy new favorite coffee house in Denver! Friday mid-morning was busy but there were still plenty of seats. Cinnamon roll was otherworldly, amazing what baking in house can do. This is also one of the few places in Denver that still does pour over coffee, but only on the weekdays!This place is the OG of coffee in the Denver area. I’ve been coming here since 2010 and despite the changes in staff (as any place opened as long should have) the greatness has never lapsed.
The espresso is excellent…they use a combination of different roasters from all over the US.

11,Whittier Cafe,"An absolute gem! I stopped here purely because I needed to use the bathroom (and  fine, I'll admit that I didn't NOT need to get some coffee and a scone) and.I was nearby, and as luck would have it I stumbled upon this amazing place.

The coffee and scone were delicious, of course, but the atmospherWalking into Whittier Café feels like stepping into a warm hug—cozy, cultural, and so beautifully put together. The vibe alone makes you want to stay awhile, but then the coffee hits: bold, smooth, and unforgettable. Their pastries are fresh and flavorful, and the customer service? Absolutely top-tiVisiting my son and found this gem cafe!! Black-Owned cafe!!! Love Love!!!

Super cute interior and vibe. The menu is straight forward with nothing to crazy. The have sweet breads and danishes. They also offer teas.

Indoor and outdoor seating. Several spots to set up and get your work on as you enjBusy neighborhood cafe with breakfast items including pastries. The raspberry scone was delicious and paired well with a latte.

Service was fast and friendly. The space is in an older building but was interesting. There are counter seats, tables and an outdoor seating area. They do have Wi-Fi availI can't recommend this cafe enough! This is one of the most authentic coffee shops I have been to in Denver. They always are playing the best music, the staff makes wonderful drinks and always have great attitudes, and the culture of the cafe is so unique and much needed in Denver's community.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 1.0, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.1, 'authenticity': 1.0}",0.95,"1710 E 25th Ave, Denver, CO 80205, USA",1.0,5,"[{'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106194261683345061467"">Whittier Cafe</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6b24aaBBbMAyihilDCpbAmf8sy2HoCJUX32ym6zUUlCeK5QBhJu5CXPbVZN4qbWpK6X-TexiBvBA46rohKCdkFGf69YBj_1-mJ_tlrqlTb9jwhhQZdJaUe_E-HDpwnCZLLW0XvpKVVG-jKoIplT4ayg8uttOE9E5QdbnQVimSRarnz3rLrKjrkQNe5rdCoo7A94TMdAE6U9eQm9kaY1AZi2yv01__hvtt3n1CWdZZN-jWHS3ofni5AK2uSAs1CzAiVSHgEhA2bDmJC20mvWfsCzLZCWIHxkMlWbsXLlTxmBw', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 3072, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117502500666591140652"">Ahmad Dbouk</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7qfDLXJeSy3tswcfMWsenHJWkCA0_Q7kq1MZoFR0gVhwaYzazcm4gbl9rzENddPLXSpV_vLvOosIRuODz18UMsdlwM9S9FlIdzSZ9DBEr5n3JUsTOAp-XG6AxErnJSNn4dBRyEDau3ZTKP5V200X14Rm8zgk1H6cq2YqQIw8Lbw8qjLbcYiiU2vTSTC4MBM-maVKE0QvAT85LvBw92wDWGf6Xq2x_zrASXL5wpR_FrP9lO5wFjKzjiGD93XjS7eipdZabaVvQ16gWe6tW3P2jrJoOhJRZmWNOwJYBUbo2eshlic9z9UgeQswVaNn5ux2aGxA_oO2bV8nekMMkSLSlQfHHZkD8Q0DPaOtIsYtWxK1LoAeYzzZjG-_sICKN_TSGVGmwnbBcC8OZRWFSUGbHm5WZly0OM0VMk0lNbgdXVbMNb1VazlGxXIcuXI0XU', 'width': 4080}, {'height': 1936, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106194261683345061467"">Whittier Cafe</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU54pIuEimEHzUDlUFvxFLPkQbPbCndgZHz8a3gwkM2XTRq_dbXh0ftiqhyCU7DdOkmgP9JInqh16FLou50gzRTZDr1lGeLurnKe4256YHz5oLXcKbEc2rIronzJRvLmzAz5iF6GCkFczMqnt0S_atzsmiya-zIxXsK3bHBIZkSFpFF_YBvO8fq8cx-AVmMfLCiu4HbkH3U8AbW_pDOWzog4pPY3l595-XOET2oqHIMWjYFAb1YeulWf0fk08QObm7QLXnhu0vE3u5Be87-3xSR0u4-lA8hyEJicEroCYDrrIQ', 'width': 2592}, {'height': 750, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114986822651316157788"">Williams Mathis</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4my96wUMvzLaQWOWhHU0kfT2yqUUSGtNmIMFwIIKUGP9HdQ342I9Sb-GW7L7lPBRHWtG2g66eADYKTkjOqlOLBSRZ0gUzPTncSfyFoHLQbsmBrYEp9tT7nXUK78lpwL4bu1eLAstzEfydWi9yuKgbDqYG25S0QFeDxIf7iKc957PKrjwCqI0cwSNPiTd59Cxp990qPWM-4NkRpyv8hK3NueMEabexfOwdedcRpGiA4nkxMbZhgROq_dtnx1r9AbXa7CfqZfEW8xyf3om08FB7e70rJKRL0VaK8PBdsGlfGkSrWed5shkUfE7fscG9kZffCrfY8i3mwnDaUvgeAnS1edx7YkSHHc_gwO9ZmqczLPXIWtG-LiTbmfowMAqgAsLVTQF6ixjqQAB6VCTc_VXJJUZxs79bm4lq-qCAgCny-jFFQQkBgrCJ8yePzXQ', 'width': 1000}, {'height': 4080, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117502500666591140652"">Ahmad Dbouk</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU56EBA3UBNJv9wLSTvV0eiFcH2TRugsBqJzNuxFFGPxXr3QdR0oJdpfCRQq5OPiD5CkF6xQaF3mcVHshFhTJGZHQv6oyT6FzQo4ifzsOXcpS4b0i496XETLHl53nAsTKIHWEj6ThQ09HY_nG4tauzCb28lgk4iAlUrO3jnP99YwH0JTffmJ6Iu2GHma2Vgx8sqGwjyxUAwiSRKzt1RHaMrvGcUxkNfIITdpaBxJfsjTyt8lkLUD_dlZFaeIqrn6OspY6GjIGpRBJp7XDh94xuWjLqTvZMbZxotKKVe3KlZEszuJDXMQgxIsEMnbJQ2NSh9eihh9S7mo3fYYyOtpO2kNg4cF2TTb0YEEe8CXQR5AJE0M6yu8xxU4cU9TV9swUGiAT3MsErilFU2Wb4TAV1Pc-DNzI7mrrjtJymRecfin3ZBZ1YCwsFhwRDnlynB3', 'width': 3072}]"

Also had butter croissant and homemade pop tart. Both were good.

Feel kinda bad for the barista having to cash and also serve at the same time.

We are visiting! Thanks for the good  coffeeLittle Owl Coffee is a cozy spot with a welcoming vibe. The staff gave great drink recommendations, and it turned out to be a perfect place to enjoy a morning coffeeOutstanding lattes.  Best I've had in downtown. Very light feel but plenty of caffeine.  Smooth, no bitterness. Entrance is on the north side of Blake just west of 16th Street.Was in Denver for 5 days and this was the only coffee shop I would go back to!!

This place had a decent latte (morning fresh dairy milk- which is amazing), but a watered down americano.

Overall, I would skip the americanos and in a pinch, the latte works.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.1, 'authenticity': 0.8}",0.9,"1555 Blake St, Denver, CO 80202, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 672, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107041036435983271956"">Little Owl Coffee</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU69zYYNDHRkSJVVpLqNA5B6k1SjGi-nMuFt1Ppgrst87Ltp6770hpMZeWwOE9p1HOWENXcM3CUpuqOZ7oei7prK0YGosJnkEoe58ztnBjEEzG7S8PDbA4UWyAbVdJ2zZ-imAhlpMP6CXIdeGS1PDf7gXaQPkduid2kVgDfCVN--RkQdv6eBqVtWXPhqGo4A9w3yU2UN4-Is6SWhN1idKCV6D4s1NauOfJ8sY4zaWH4Zqn5ODIbZtyUZk-Vwt9XeWs7A7SRvVZZssaYPnyrdEE09AgvLBTmE_FCyHbDTbgTP3A', 'width': 1000}, {'height': 960, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107041036435983271956"">Little Owl Coffee</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU76tU4oQrqn3UaSdTuiB3OaO4fa8TVY9a-Uu4bdppcql2jppO72cKK9w2pO1XtvSpzKCU529CX59EkpJfc435E_8DPMLxqWX_bhP7j6fKz_hH9ppJcD4orh0zebLNiEa6YeWoBpNjFwF4uLeIW44eZ-J_D0wDD-JuHgdWic9HSdQbRu-SAwdcsx5sTCn-TAO_ntiXcYsH2vE5kWVvxX-TeoGuzg5KriLxlBU30fB-78CwZVw_zn8cX-5Ujoz0CzUfyMggV-FxNx19EtwMG68MFFwfd6ssxEJvlnxyibbt-gEA', 'width': 720}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113539232199539111195"">Hagan Dalton</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5pMxnAE01TnwmGWkjDuXFklnK5bINuRwBdtccJCw7DTdknCRrLyD2M4nnsLMkTlGiDQjbVU-fIQkqEr9kCKl5VsNYEmmMQPdRTGMiUDqnpT8Ujc86rzmjVqt2q9eo7oqs9gDPkr0kFIKrzhi0hCGzYxrMDhOqJBunbY7qC-OuXESus8N1DI9l8qONH_-sHmESu0wbYhVZP77nMMYyKVSO4jSdAJxNMo9ZIsU7ErNHdF0nnieTx3LRpAjTEkcsuXnUZv6a267BdlSagw_peRqmyUGocoXO3drCrciFhWTRBF7Qpb2-IwZYE12UgKqR-aYlasgMs0If2UF7GJTN_9HOmaYRT_DseSNLn53Og3gKBU6qvEPN7kwbhHvDBg9l1W98pV4eXRxDs-BsLf-Tm2RrU0H7LBqVZG0J62kqu6I4mJg4p', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 1665, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103449616368896674545"">Alex Whiteman</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5O0YqlZUpU4fbBBZo893m2XvZxM-6f9Fh8CkCfC-RfcKNuQ4NqnnUn8IIDGS38CcRQodCoprrPKT9_toTI6xFjPnMIfnwTMTXTtcGWPwbmZmUKKxrWfMsU8aZflsq1Vy56AFXb_D70ah7DibcPnIVtybZt6ok6YszE1-Sk6ESonvXH-mxuZuvJVOWXT--tcASw0GPPi1N3X332l_gyeqwbnjn9IiP8W3XL3tQ61sS7J6rnrAgCfJQh8RGGEDbeTDdoegyMFqGMqdg8p_vrbdYAq5WPYhJUWl6yoih7pMmWDD3f9JzAiZWoXmUtO8KuHiVEL2Ef-OVdjcFeIigMKu7S6ZHtqE5xs6nvoFQR5TeYze9J-4swd_25wqgxF3eD7iJ4ge534H-hYRAs-m5U_uLA93LM-bneZmOne2UVbROYSXwo', 'width': 2232}, {'height': 4080, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109110571833689564884"">Rosalee Chan</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6-cROFlA1dMVWsTU3fyBUkep20UI6jjJes60BVtvnxG0LG71XUgKO1rba20PTNtTuCRzYdqpmhuKTCvPWW72mDfHGR854BvKV_lNVhQUo493FUq8Cw2nea1QvMzvmDKSTznPVnneg8vKPs-BMsR_vrTVSIQkRIX0kjp4DcqzX0ckKVVkh95fvaYKoBSaPX15ANblZlsSeYa2J5ARfJmhMGBS-YOu9-tsx871Auz2KEuzn8O0B58MfRNTk9_Q-0aY0b0tAYoQPZShYgmT2JV6MH25Tl3nxK8QuGezlrHFVuTKVnj-pDwJrgUfafmuHtLpEkUs0s7xZkHjJHqUGuY7KSjTEh8WXeK_AM86KeXr-IARTZf8obOBg0quBTKdmAHhQFlHVN6IgD-6107m7Yn_swb6KDEZhudlopAIcgvyuvJTa1bFTndPfT3WSh5Cga', 'width': 3072}]"
13,The Weathervane Cafe,"This place is a diamond in the rough! We were in town for our anniversary and needed coffee before taking on the day! One of the locals suggested the Banana fosters latte and it did not disappoint, it was liquid gold in a cup. I got it iced and still had all the flavor of an actual bananas foster! WI got the caramelized banana latte and the matcha lavender scone. LOVED the scone, the frosting balanced out the scone part very well imo. The banana latte wasn’t as sweet as I was expecting which was a plus.

There is plentiful outdoor patio seating for the size of the place. Not as much indoor seaAdorable coffee shop with tasty sandwiches and good coffee.  They have lots of seating on their outdoor balcony and patio as well as inside.  I tried their Cubano sandwich and a cold brew and wasn’t disappointed.

A couple outdoor tables were open at 2pm on a Saturday. Quirky (but comfortable) environment on the inside. Was immediately intrigued by the one of a kind sandwiches on the menu.

Tried the Strawberry Rhubarb Melt, what a show stopper! RThe ambiance in this place is killer! It's very cozy inside with cute decor.

I don’t think I’ve paid that little in YEARS. This was my first visit in and I was extremely pleased. We didn’t have to wait at all. Service was pretty fast.

16,Coffeegraph,"Great coffee. I got a chance to meet the owner. It’s a small business who are specialized in making some good quality drinks. We had the coconut matcha with a pinch a vanilla syrup. it’s not too sweet and it’s very refreshing. Highly recommend it.A tasty and unique coffee shop. I had the Aren Five Spice Latte which was outstanding!  Flavors here I haven’t seen anywhere else. They also have a beautiful custom La Marzocco espresso machine if you’re into those types of details.This place is easily the best coffee i have ever tasted. It is also the most adventurous coffee I have ever tried. Im still dumbfounded that palisade peaches could mix so perfectly with ginger oolong and cold brew! The owners are extremely kind and had great conversations with us both times we've weIncredible espresso and coffee, but also creative fun options and lots of non coffee options too. Great vibes and I didn't have the pastries but they looked delicious.

The person behind the counter was willing to chat with you about options or if you had any questions.

Highly recommend!!One of the best matcha I’ve had. The pandan syrup added was aromatic and delicious. We also got the spiced coffee and the croissant pastry which were both amazing as well. The owners are so lovely. Definitely recommend and will be returning frequently.","{'casualness': 0.8, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.4, 'authenticity': 1.0}",0.95,"3800 Julian St, Denver, CO 80211, USA",,5,"[{'height': 3600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113063191869151631744"">Ian Boyd</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5kg7H7BBKdZTfmIJXid2EWk7avjmnYiavUPpYIdEGTdrg3m_ISFOFlM49LTWvAs16nh2RDrV7YoGdURmRfmsuIZ4NlckrqqP-6eCZ2I-u8HVUogmfZpQg8llE4_Xm5XuqSbvNmzirW14IQypHUW2dnl83TiUMSRwpoWcC4gjMeiTxRFUwYRmV_pA44Io0aYQXAgV0rG3VwTaeivXTjGpBpLAtU4e7cmEHaAwwV9_yiArF3Mr_-SXFUS27WqED80eFCT8Zs7zDJRViIGqcULpf_zC3vhKNVpBK2OYrCiIu99D-E32KNwZA8xoDfiK6LPbkvTyLht_BJ1Bcn-_WiBl3vMZhiIG0ll7uVoTL_WoJN5Yds32Fky9R9QE7LUUgWhGn20xFpLoODEChzE1eaVp9FZiJ0ujnruRJb59UqBaGVMrAFjTGt1UTlWkZBbg', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109693189767042375830"">Coffeegraph</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6JvJV7J4vEF5b_f9MAnp8u_Lfny_S-ckJTu7f9szzLCi6CZmSJYUjYfsmAKJo3DRXBT4rKop2F2SKgxjESeCbLDTxAMPguhMG5nYByf72RPxfVL-V_-MZi10V2ZBmh3-aBcxk234vbIFgHp55eVkVZqqDBuMqnAYbGIn_plNsH9dlzyIJ4BeE46PT65-ZVvmSh8IxjADKGPhdDhvwUKwluDHHAWUelXDAV--WpUsqEKR88ip07PzWp3zWCEaWUFSildx9BMCXrAZszNN_32lXSUQucTkpIeGbyontYG-eAnQ', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/106437490380698204465"">Gabriella Gallego</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7CJV-iM0BuUw99dqfeMRTA79eAXKwIoYkvhGlyBHMcQUh50Bcx4XG3eDHPJSIDgcyqPWyBss0ZPSECHe18jm9-UYYgOBPPpsLcF5ccYqDlDdRuEThui2LPirGnI86tpK_786-Kmm468H1qIn4ZaNYTIQem_bGTbbcsdr-XOBDzwm05URg5UPpKDxW3lzVMYVYJqsVIIygIRbYHfwoykiuXau4YXuuoweQDtjLYLsl5ABN1QTHs1pekpbqV4aX4-Bf0LTwdTUA36wuAHnRDmNMvzNcy1_8iV3VLA6i3sP0CSZ5_gnVlo1SjSQvk_qwec-W5Ym8Tl391FIXgjZkQ5mY2dyLIxzPxOTpvyJeGTJVUTZW572MQb0icvtqzr4tqZ9MQTXgpnyrnGIy0lRs0PRhDPoETzHprJglgt_lm7Pcs2O5Bhy9IAaMZIxP8pY3r', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 3791, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/109693189767042375830"">Coffeegraph</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4nHj5Zvrg_D7NYJJYZC77enaajqNPcr-1p3XFpeGh-fMNpG4-6TnpBi_zy40E6hDapif45OHzvKj5urooKSywdprZDRg_Iiksskztz0xC0dxvE3HqdJpAhF9beJ54bXVtV_-G29A4uX7nH7gBKSSrSf7K8wZDjJAByOXq49NWXivAmQgq6lonNvx77FmmK7qlQiLDqV7mtd7idnWgu13FGbj7bS9fyKUjcFn5ogfEuhA7QsLCJ-Fjv_26FFR9wEHhsv4WvH8YnuJusjpfNGQZzjhWQAK2lYDSSU5MeLrwWvQ', 'width': 2398}, {'height': 1115, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/117419746870400870183"">Elizabeth Jarrard</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5OSK-w0JU82GpgNplKmZRt4z_PV7aBWSf0khY6dEFfNSEC7eQr-ymz58D9XdAicq0ClWvdUREKZnuFz42ITDCZnzE97S8Qs5S_VHjloEcRLpkT2HXoSskqSLSZBrq0kPjT5vjWrWYGr32KxPUtyVYLCAj7OdqKkYAZvd4wh-Ni894m8lBVPAcDUMHZbnXbBbi9E3ZaVLcuohAF-dt9e6Yvn0zAOINcf-xrBVEm0ZpUBv3pgN9YB0vdhp_qoxZvqc1rB0xHQwVCgTvjxxK2W5krJxcQlCE6ZpOqeBuCt0ERrbBS_3fvDA7ciVBT8uSFl0Ss1bEINMEr6MklCNQaxe-mdjl1eSJgiD4tkKpHvuxFn68Hkf08Gx1pqz1oLpMwf0xVGTr0laeflQy5iIs38OKQH9mPAcH2ZEM056QidPvuzdpRzuTSBTuImXumDtym', 'width': 938}]"
17,Scr3am & Sugar Coffee Co.,"This was a spur of the moment choice, as we were looking for a coffee shop that was nearby, and the name intrigued me. I checked out the place a little on Google and it looked fun - plus 5 star review level with reviews in the triple digits, which is so rare. It did not disappoint. The vibe of this Never knew this place even existed. The puffed bagel was awesome. They have a gift shop that was full of goo and gore. Great for Halloween all year round. They had pictures from famous horror movies as well as porcelain haunted dolls and also jewelry. It was quite amusing all.the stuff they had.As a horror movie buff, I had to check this place out. It did not disappoint! The atmosphere is spooky and welcoming with loads of horror art. Their coffee is to die for and they have more than just coffee but a variety of horror themed drinks and snacks. Definitely recommend this coffee shop if youA bit different experience in coffee in this horror themed coffee shop attached to a similar shop and theater. The coffees are good including the seasonal specials such as Samoa Kooky Latte. They have a small selection of pastries.

The service was fast and friendly. The space is effectively decoratPretty cool place, both drinks we got were pretty good. Wish they had a bigger selection of snacks but it was still great.

For sure might be coming back if I am in the area. The prices are pretty decent.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 0.7, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.1, 'authenticity': 1.0}",0.95,"1974 S Acoma St, Denver, CO 80223, USA",,5,"[{'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115824108539930524052"">Scr3am &amp; Sugar Coffee Co.</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5D99Qybb4fbw-TlEmLz2j5sS2idn9WJcDi8j9lLLotrCzRXpMo-N-PmZKXiHWRJfaFA2PAI-UajAAg5vveErSZsETNcG0-TH4ZlVymPd5AKJx-lwkhQZOn6b9x22Te1C01cGOragjVYz1WU7GiY54NrlJaKx9D5vPjj5CG3h22WGXcjC_eIBOuDvG-8wFJ0ue7BrFHC4PyJJala9o6vLQ5yktbg80eIRgmQEJtDR6dESAO2o_y-HCz1og_q1AJWh6yCnFigB6ykbqLStYmbQIbbUIrOEtmceOJaPR_CCKr1w', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 1600, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115824108539930524052"">Scr3am &amp; Sugar Coffee Co.</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU573StxzYdTaZ1hcBVCViwDbVCVWlL_DhCGq26mKbfsUeAFakRaOcUZgeFNsZlIEYNJRZ1aObXS3TY2j5Zm2hxBL0EeU92bpexMeJ691bGPlCPeaeEdCIpXWyk_0Av4Ps8tCUHIRK0WttWTf0y08lhstVq1y2DOMt8ilg3Vbf8n2YRaCZOAya7YiNy-UOHTCC-uv9xI2V-hq_ZhL0KELD8ayMAYpnYoIwevMw2xVVvkCQMdXW--HD8IsXpCQW62ETyAZEx96p5mlLvRE4sL3Xgmd7WTQU5gIU8Pnn4pVPEQ9A', 'width': 1200}, {'height': 3024, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/102968505588967374410"">Cassandra Diaz Barriga</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6IX7K4nq7xeM-z9cEB1Hax-chISrOsWiZUnkPurerNWOyoe66n5sD4oxOMtNFWmlk3FlvG0DsRx3NQNS-Wvg2ImYE7ZzxeBKRp7IIB2VLTBkoMPhVxobtxsvHWkHzhDu7IC2g9jikQjx8yPFWDlNs9mpTHDbGqDm9fw_YKCHTI6ADSaSqbvUr3GXMba6TI7bC3kdFt8AdSql3tf3HeXb9kwEUuGoW3yfIfUORQjTihl4JDYMFL_RCRNyXqE-LyMS0X13fxrVzY8U29wu0Rb9TPC7hdDMQd4pcgHL0eFGl03WyiwlES6CAkp4MwOjW8A38-i3WQ6tCMgxOSohCxuX7uVkdMyDB-lzkd4SJPAKRrcvnn3BPIq-u9I0burH71idnZwlWvc6Ezfz1n9Q3e6SaYXlS9ZbmobYgwKj0', 'width': 4032}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116276544466811851980"">Alissa McCoy</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4XnnEAGceVJnyIpFEnxYDshT7Gvwy2AphCj9MrgqGB3EiCM0zcQOlxhus7tCoSsNv2E3cqZeuaNUHS3RsQxRb28K9wJMyZxH-B_vsg7NrKoeRK5cdLePxgs18nqj_d5CDalZF1_3Yi1l6JhEC54oLQBbUVdtPDBvNk1Cyv9ONcKihimfGQJB3EweQ5ysYfOJgFc8pMJ8DfyTEMUhMgjy-8O2isELoUukE68ac2dZDyqQCdmjvpUykRp8PPFzCsGbk_aBAxcXQqhY8L7ytgxvYG9_fBgiWQm_-YeKBAqXWbTrw9BaY_wjdyk_3mkg-N88BMYXvrbbtkIH4ZZVUtOJpmejcW8dPKFC10OnBVXl96zh6NrI0DBxs-yf-yE7Y3PGM4EBJi5Bu_5SibJ0mudBpzcGT3ox8mAYdGhRaCu_w', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111722337464525214845"">Jordan Wilde</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6w1QF6hXMwk_mMAr56HD5GYaS0M_DEmTQWkG4PbLYB79BphLQxR2sFCnQPidvBpqh6C9WN5Yo8KwX2Qmu5D_pOB6es9YQjuQJSDurPhbjMkV03LaTyrmjbCHkY7JISh3mNqdmRzM5_Ei7FMP0BtxE3GtHBb1kGaFKDc7ZR_l7RZqLS-yB2dfAqRx9s7c2VlkfJ5_kH9HJ7bYreyerVI7wJhy7WPhHDIPBi9q4qjfuNp99hv5JTlhxJrlV1jDvRQo_qClaQ-mILCIz1Bhr_AqGTT5Y44Ty1rEZM7vrSK8RQO6seabx43DegqjfwUeI7cRSwot-Xy8quhKcalDi_2Nu5Pl6d9dIFCLgzFNx3u6xgKyp3f8p0-QD889qeOsXE5i6OMUggaw6xue6RpVkUl2zWCYIxj7Yoyh5VcGJoQOwnOuY58arjYYumlERyKhum', 'width': 3024}]"
18,Side Pony Coffee & Cocktails,"What a fun little spot for a bite and cocktails! Clean, neat, and run by a very friendly and upbeat staff, the food was excellent and the drinks very creative - though I’ll skip the lavender infused one - can you say “laundry detergent”? - but no judgments for those who go for it! Fantastic waffle wThe espresso and honey latte were so good. The avocado toast is one of the best I've tasted and would highly recommend. Laid back atmosphere and friendly staff.Happy hour was great! I had my first aperol spritz and it was delightful! Didn’t get the bartenders name but he was super sweet and chatted with us about the menu and drink selection. Our server was also helped us find some great wine, half priced bottles of wine all night on Wednesdays! Cute spot fFabulous cafe and vibrant atmosphere.  Loved the food, drinks, and decor.  The day I was the they had the Easter bunny taking pictures with the neighborhood dogs and rescue puppies for adoption.  It was so special! Will return,  highly recommend.Love! Friendly staff, very chill vibe at 8:30AM on a Friday morning. If you're here to work, there are no outlets under the black bench seating (which is very comfy btw) but there are a few under the bar at the front. WiFi speed is great - 490mbps download/86mbps upload. 👩🏻‍💻

19,Rivers and Roads Coffee,"We aren't in Denver often,  but since we heard so many great things about this place we had to stop in for a visit while we were in town.
Very friendly service,  great coffee and treats, nice atmosphere, and cute decor/merch.
I enjoyed the Strawberry Shortcake Sweet Bread, which was very soft & moisThis place is amazing. You can tell the folks working here love what they do - everyone is super kind and the food is consistently so flavorful and delicious. It’s also very affordable considering most places in Denver upcharge $3-4 dollars for anything GF. Will be coming back again and againMy husband and I are both gluten free, and are incredibly impressed! They are great for most dietary restrictions. The breakfast sandwich was so yummy and filling! I ordered the chai and it might be the best I have had! Perfect balance of creamy, sweet and spicy! My husband ordered the butter coffeeRivers and Roads Coffee in Denver has delicious sandwiches and well-made drinks. The staff is super friendly and the outdoor seating is perfect on a sunny day. Only downside: they don’t have almond milk, just coconut and oat. Still, definitely worth a visit!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Had a wonderful lunch at Rivers and Road Coffee in Denver with my daughter and mom! 🥗🍽️ We ordered the pastrami, and it was absolutely delicious.

And it's free accesThis bar has a great vibe — good music, well-made cocktails, and a really nice view of the mountains.

I also appreciate that they don’t let it get overcrowded, which makes the experience much more enjoyable.

That said, the prices and the long wait times don’t really match the overall experience. IThe view is not okay at all because there are many tall buildings block the view.
Staffs are very attentive and very helpful.
Crab taco is very delicious.
Chicken satay is too sweet It’s not satay at all.
It is teriyaki chicken.

22,Union Lodge No.1,"Great selection of hand crafted cocktails. Drinks were well made and reasonably priced for the service and experience.

But order something that allows these bartenders’ experienPassing through town and met one of my former co-workers here at this bar. She said that it always pops up on her list of best bars and places to go to. We got there just after 6:00 and the place was pretty packed and looks like the crowd turns over pretty quickly as the bartenders are really friendIf you are looking for a great tasting and unique cocktail, this place is a must. The atmosphere is awesome and the service was over the top (especially from Austin and Abby). I will definitely stop in again next time I am in Denver.Wow, what a great place! The vibe and atmosphere are just right. Rustic look, good music to set the tone and great drinks.

The menu pays homage to early century cocktails but has plenty of modern options as well. Drinks are fairly priced as most seem to be in the $1?.00’s.

We can tell the atmosphere here is really nice definitely during cocktail hours but we couldn’t make it. Easy to say that we had a good time though!Their happy hour deals are worth it - $8 espresso martinis! I don’t think there is any food on the happy hour but the couple small things I’ve had here have been great. Bread and butter comes with flaky sea salt.

The location is perfect and their outside space is great.Craft cocktail bar serving house signature and classic cocktails as well as beer and wine.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Ordered a Bemba Rosa and a Paper Star.  Both tasted as good as they looked.  Great presentation and flavors.  We just had some coffees and muffin, but cute place to go on dates and cocktail collection also seems pretty good.I stopped in for a drink and a snack on a Sunday afternoon & I loved this place! It’s so light and bright. The food was good and very well plated. Also, the servers are so kind. I would definitely just sit here and do some work or come for a drink later in the day.","{'casualness': 0.8, 'comfort': 0.9, 'energy': 0.5, 'elegance': 0.7, 'authenticity': 0.7}",0.9,"1660 Wynkoop St Suite 100, Denver, CO 80202, USA",,5,"[{'height': 3200, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104999012571598942203"">The Wild</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4sw4PAsi4-9sBvO4lqjE5RZetfyVnr5t4WKJ-KoMq9gZLxTGQ-9lhhRuZtehe7JZL0-aOuie6TFRxlnTLh8GAzyMxm_DlFcMUl6S-4qEX1HZcE9WANLwgbuRPWU1Yw_sqt8AJ8RZ571QF5hufJRFmh4kEUNigU8NHsE2pUhzLOc9O7JZxrhZsO4v7Pqa1fRJzGDE5ahtUzUusgEWR9vdkrVPNC-vmmEkxJ0YaDwkaIknwO0wm2p8VesHfUqc9RDT0T8sYmJiBs5llPPWiP2Fl0Q7TciiV9ho93ZaCRKS_6_A', 'width': 4800}, {'height': 3000, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/103195913236844625126"">K</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU76Wjmt_a0QXQuy1EmtoWMEJ8vWY-jU1xBZr8--DZW6QMtPSsLo7X6RghuP7LtSM3CfEA2qaanqp3XdJQ3-I186_f4BPQ0nRWYDMuyTU9xxb2OoegsfUC2BjQSigqBBllAhcX7wXto2ETSPmhdhBdkmj5-6HTAYR7k1yNmED2AYz2rwcy_G7VSD3UetgUgTqr9pU4NHowP5KCxVzFJnbN-cX9lXguiZSHoOTyGKMwLa_cm6b4-nP9zGDqwpJhWIu-UVahttoOas5AdZho88yen_QLbGM77dgX1jPhDZIknzdcQ-V89MxI-ZHJQqTZIg9RYqVgJemfuPKqQNLbAmEx-JupRYMdFZ4NDv6w7X3o4ASlGf3Z8TU80XRnSZhzGU06yhktvYjMpBo--zXGD1x2WwprOwrTCq6LWCUOi-wBjp4uI', 'width': 4000}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/105574687115458794949"">Joy Carnahan</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6zm9kbvmOvrSXw_-bN5lTbwJSkVlFG6odsrkhEHmrA-ONJIqDzEEKg6j2cmPBdqgMBRaOX8odTYGY8opTntROtUas37sINykktzomq6IMBAg_gseAcE8JhXwGtPpmHdaZJe37Nb2ymjn4ho0KAOAa-VH9p5xw1UD60O34_385YszXTlPNyDGcihEefdCKg1GlCv1S2Pvmj1zl_AkChBwLZoIGeSoQTSMw_Y4OcwHp3n4mVVQA6s8EbEAPQTBO7ZaxxoF-71Ud12xU8Y1xekCCFhXTXXN5AUl5eqarc6Z9oZZuwnpikElWpx_Cmbfjj-bDwmYEaDqs6OOIbkelfyOr6lwMiGdX9477Glxf3yss8vyDJdWKi8IbSP6BPBbeLNA5HjQzXdyjjdOhuhqaT-rgqq-ObHQAmSfMKdDY2tcIrusnw', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/114339814146410201906"">Laila Davidson</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU4T-TaN46sOmI3C2Rezjl_0FM_-MspNA8RzusgrbKMkzwWMHqFOLF-sP20oKePpzQdwO-OhjxPk1WuSSR8MVEG92nrzMlCeK3cG8hvJ7jbLslOI_g6w8LCejp3tJAlrT6BCgJ53un1qDsSCR90yKpvBLGgWqJ15MSLYn-Nwqb3gKt1a0Xhbg6kzSIcSwOA8pkL9Jlxe-eox7SV1xaw3vuUBWag_BYAW7CAs5I9CU2BVTf8tsreSYOOfroKFMxb9BMflpHbdygUsxjRS7vfEeBtNDzm2m4DaXgetcLeHt5GN6ZXxU2CRCKBapL7fKsz7hPne3qQlRfjSzloWkptbBKdbIvZl3pSQ9PD5Liq8AmHfXAJFQFm560piKh4J96RR1b8M9sRvQ2QqoUuqJcs9mA0_5yk7JMhdD9Vk6TuP89VwSyD-', 'width': 3600}, {'height': 3685, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116284672846759803252"">Jill DeCandio</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7QJLWcWV1fj4_IhuNx0M5m5p2Bq6M-_RKzm-64lR9kW1GeaturWmVt--Ndmk4slk0wVBV2-XnfE8ppRjSd-SuUNeV072bJlWeZGNDbjO5ngUtEtndDe586d4rVAzwc5Sube90BRI0K4EyTziTBF228StvSbm9cMjrY3ymjY2tvEVoG1BHRez-Ru28bsydQwCkXuOHTIRMrLF7M00CmFfGgZ1DnyDQKZi1qd2aVB4_gEUT8Lg_jn1XnI7Fla_itF0YPmCSOz8nVbx6kn2BJROEGEHEvgFj1j2SuGCb6ro0LX_7H-OmSvEjCKTlNSK5AvpU9pY4NB9q5QUWu6maOrjCuFiGe08_sO9N7jCQ4mF6_lCLGOL2No1ekHWM46-AEXZEjeQEuECbRrz1hjMLUDkdkv21XVzafxhsmUm9UWIQ', 'width': 3023}]"
26,Mockingbird,"Love this spot in Denver. Amazing drinks and service.  Really cool set up and little place to hang all over the venue.  They host music here and have a great crowd.  Definitely a vibe if you’re in the area.This is a very unique venue,  more of an art piece then your regular bar or club.  They have multiple themed rooms that have a different vibe then the others.  Go check it out!This is one of the coolest clubs in Denver! Great music, great vibes, super friendly staff, and the decorations are AMAZING! Very artsy and vibey. Lots of cool places to hang out if dancing isn't your vibe for the night.What an amazing environment… definitely for the adult crowd, that likes to dance, have great drinks, and an atmosphere that takes you too another level…

Great bartender by Vic, really seems to engage with the guests and make sure that each drink is just the way you want itComing from NYC being reccomended to this as a safe space to exist in(similar to house of yes) I left in tears at the realization that this space is simply riding the wave of “rave/plur culture” but not delivering in ANY WAY. I’ve never left a space feeling so sad about our collective  future.

27,Coyote Ugly,"SO cool in here! Huge bar with tons of space, great music, and lots of games . We played pool and had a few drinks - bar tender was great & helpful, lots of good photos ops and stuff to look at all around the walls - they sell swag shirts and hats in the front store. Would be cool to come back on a NO food, NO service n here is the atmosphere
This establishment was less than enjoyable, during the floor game (musical squares) a female SHOVED my niece out of the spot and proceeded to push her again, not one security staff addressed this issue with the woman. Thats how trouble starts, they're HIRMy wife and I live across the street and came in for one drink on Monday as we’ve never been to a coyote ugly before and honestly we probably won’t go back. It seems like a cool place for younger people wanting to party, but the insane overpricing for drinks made us not want to go back. My wife had It was our first time there and definitely not gonna be last!  We loved the bartender girls vibe and atmosphere was also nice. We danced on the bar with the bartender and the shots are also affordable and good though. I think weekdays are not super busy, but still they’re doing great.Country bar that’s typically not playing country music honestly. Most of the girls are very nice and super fun so service is great. They do water down their beers as well so ask for it in a can.

Ambience is very nice and bright. I woulThis unforgettable meal took place at Founding Farmers, a restaurant well-known in Washington, D.C. for its hearty American dishes and farm-to-table concept. I actually decided to come here because Adam recommended it to me—and I am so glad I followed his advice.

I recently dined at Grazie Nonna in Washington, DC, and it was a charming spot for Italian-American comfort food.

The service was friendly and attentive, which made the evening even better.

The menu lives up to the name with tons of different cuisines represented in the dishes (very unconventional… I’ve never eaten at a restaurant with this much variety). Everything we had was delicious. I loved the Lebanese fried rice and the meatloaf I found this gem when searching for the best brunch restaurants in DC before my visit. Everything on the menu sounds great, so it was hard to decide. We got the Lebanese Fried Rice with Falafel and the S""Eggs""y Sandwich - both were amazing! I almost didn’t get the fried rice because I was leaning toUnconventional Diner really lived up to the hype. The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and welcoming throughout the whole visit. I tried the chicken and waffles for the first time and I wouldn’t regret that choice one bit.

Nonetheless this place deserves a great review!

The restaurant is gorgeous from the moment you walk in, the high ceiling and elegant decor draws you in. You can get a breathtaking view from upsEnded up stopping by after visiting the American Art Museum and was pleasantly surprised by our meal here! It ended up being a late lunch (3:00) so the restaurant was not packed which allowed for a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. The host was friendly and waitress was quiet but sweet and informative. BaBeautiful restaurant. Delicious food. Great service, with a fun personality (Melka)! My friend and I shared the catfish entree, a long with sides of dirty rice and the collard greens with kimchi before going to Ford's Theatre. Just the right amount of food and very flavorful.After trying the national harbor location, we decided to try the downtown location because we really enjoyed our previous experience. Of course this time we were not disappointed also. I think the cornbread we had at the national harbor location was better, with more hot flavor.

8,Zaytinya,"Zaytinya is one of my favorite go to restaurants. I love their outdoor seating patio, which they have invested in since COVID. The patio has covered tents and actual fine dining chairs and tables that elevate the area. I’ve eaten outdoors during temperate winter days as well and their heaters work wReally nice restaurant!
Great feel.
Busy but not too loud.
Terrific food.
We did Pre-theatre fix prix menu.
Four courses.
Generous portions.
Everything was great
Especially loved the Fattoush, lamb, chicken & brussel sprouts…
Tasty, light, but filling…!
Across from the Portrait Gallery.
Highly RecomMy husband and I went here for brunch and got their $70 special and I must say, I have never been to a spot where we’ve enjoyed brussel sprouts as much as I have right here. Needless to say, their portions are good size (not too big), and their food is beautiful and delicious. Their bread is also veLove the location and outdoor patio. The food is outstanding. We love the shareable plates and the unique spins on traditional dishes. Even the bread is fun- the puffy bread shows up to the table and is then used for all the unique dips and spreads.
Love the chicken and even the garlic paste.My partner and I dined here during DC Restaurant Week. We each had a special four-course Mediterranean meal.

If I could offer any advice, listen to their recommendations for food and drink. We had amazing cocktails, small plates, entrees and dessertsWe have been wanting to try this new Mediterranean place. We had an early dinner around 5 o’clock on a Sunday night.The food was delicious especially loved the beef kebab. Pita bread is hands down the best in the area. Everything is fresh and tasty. Service was great too. Outdoor seating is lovely.We came for restaurant week and had a great time. It was four courses and we added the four drinks to go with it. It was especially nice that they did regular menu items + regular sizes so you could get a sense of what it is usually like. The bread and dips were great, we really liked the potatoes aWe had an unforgettable dinner at ala in DuPont. Our server Jamie was a wonderful host and accommodating for our dietary restrictions. The food was some of the best we’ve had in DC. Some favorites were the za’atar labneh, baba ghanoush, duck prosciutto, and chicken thigh kebab. Do not skip on the whThis place was good !!

The ambience was warm and inviting, with a nice vibe all around. I onI stopped by today and found out there was a special event happening in the back of the shop. Even with the event going on, everyone was still very welcoming. Tried their coffee. It was amazing! The Pour Over and Piccolo hit the spot. Although there weren’t any empty seats inside, I really enjoyed mHaving heard great reviews about this place, I decided to try out their mango matcha latte

I was very disappointed as it seems like I was just served a milkshake. The drink was overly sweet and I could barely taste the matcha in it. I understand the mango makes it sweet by default, but this seemed Stunning little coffee shop with clean restrooms and polite staff! I can say confidently that this is the best coffee shop in DC. Their coffee is rich and well flavored, it is not to sweet and not burnt. Definitely will return and recommend!!My partner recommended me this place and omg it was amazing.

12,YELLOW Georgetown,"Good food, but the line is a bit much on weekend mornings. Try a different day if you could. The lamb shoulder pita sandwich was fantastic - tender, flavorful, and really hit the spot. The fattoush was not that great.Love this place. I see what the reviews are talking about. The only downfall of it all is that it’s in a very congested area, with cars and people. But it might just be worth the hassle. There is street parking but of course it is limited. The next alternative would be the garage parking lot which tI always saw the long lines on weekends, so this time I decided to go during the week, and it worked out. It was still busy, but not nearly as crowded as on the weekend.
For my overall experience, I’d definitely give this Café 5 stars, the great food, warm atmosphere, and excellent service.
The stafGet here early because there is almost always a line.  It is worth it though.  We got a breakfast pita and it was the perfect ballance of light and savory.  Both the pita sns the eggs were nice and fluffy and the fresh sauce brightened it up.  The coffee was smooth but rich too.  Overall it's a goodHABIBI!! This is the best gem of DC and Georgetown! The line is 100% worth the wait, and moves very fast. Everything is incredibly flavorful and delicious. Tastebuds will definitely be in heaven. I did confirm that the lamb and chicken are halal!

13,Big Bear Cafe,"Nice cafe, lovely setting, nice people.

Friendly servers and smiley faces when you come in, lovely setting (vines on the outside of the building which made in look like an Italian place, and nice wooden tables inside and out), and nice atmosphere with a good soundtrack!

Coffee and drinks were surpI enjoyed a flat white and breakfast burrito here. The overall atmosphere was lovely to enjoy my breakfast and read for a bit. Lots of people were working from their laptops (they have wifi), chatting with one another, or grabbing something to-go. The staff was friendly, and there was ample seating Lovely little café, and a lovely little neighborhood, they also have a farmers market outside on Sunday mornings, which makes for a full Sunday experience: cute latte, and baked goods and a stroll of the stands, what more could you ask for? 🥰
I won’t claim it. It’s the best coffee I’ve ever had, andWe hosted our 60-person wedding at Big Bear Cafe in May 2025, and we are so thrilled we did. From the start of our venue search, the event manager Bri was attentive and organized. On the day itself, the staff were so proactive, helpful and kind. Many guests told us that they loved the venue, and thaHad our wedding here and had a wonderful experience. They were easy to work with, the staff was great, and the food and drinks were delicious. I would highly recommend them if you are considering having your event here.","{'casualness': 0.9, 'comfort': 1.0, 'energy': 0.6, 'elegance': 0.2, 'authenticity': 0.4}",0.9,"1700 1st St NW, Washington, DC 20001, USA",2.0,5,"[{'height': 2670, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104577713125210832343"">Big Bear Cafe</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU6NynPIvHd7bQOV88ouu5qvVFoQrQU3QcEXv9bFLIS2V3IuFRfqpmy09AMR3ZhLduFWyi0c2LIlhIOFC1u2qv2TZVnl4gv4TpKnciX7jf1H8MsN3JTxokTD5DWUjynMpSLfhp1IOpK2WJvrOFms84Gk_rrg1y78jhOe-KDx40NwyT7kY64sT6AbJ7V7hx1Ehl8vrnykDDZptwDsP6eYAl4TmXn90PQsxWNtrLHy1xPBwXvQxrcpfgKjMH-jnlj0wxIg6SoEXk0UpEhdckrN2vykSzTLT7xEXiC2UC6njE506w', 'width': 4000}, {'height': 427, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104577713125210832343"">Big Bear Cafe</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7WlzBUUigJJ4vHUjOEYiDXyLR3fxooR4FiiH8P2VnqHdSdlW-rjT9wc6eUO2ab8hCybgDnP7CdN2U_l0JRdWuZ2fM7crFnSogA_-l55MxirllkQj4jYAVV0qepsZJLCSAWuH7QH9lFQZZg641dl_sRvbD8A0E1LgZTtpzUTzEGYWgYlF2dcyO3sqaSpFH35wxThHhA4DBARXtwq9Fp4cMcXjW2V5vVC4Ksrnk_uZMXK7xc-G6-9iRLRt5YKni0BY-HsXvZWae6HC_AZ21tTtWihlLEVtSYIFgJLx7tJucFUA', 'width': 640}, {'height': 4032, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104851900980481013807"">Victoria Hunt</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7j5ogTWraWFSc32eicrkzlFwrn-aleK4fk3SjlB9ZeKht8Rhpe2B9cnNJx-3XQ-RULP2WkourLEvWHYUzGp22iy4eDmIEi3cKkHm6IjGKQQIyAKYvrS6PVREICoyqFaJOAnDEOwn6abieUJXVgJ-qtCfX_M3Zci845OPcF4olY2W3cSOxI6S1EsLgk2M6XAbY_zGQlEaJoXSCXKqCBranhoh7atO4acKOtvpp5RWofB46SzYY9ynMcjfWCzY4B3YZWLPmjE8NT1r-gz2LgG-CexsNt0wEeltlFtinwr5jO9W2VpseI4juNXiVEErxHl7kZJ1YtSYemxdx4mqNRJQkn29DvW5vj7npbMMpfqF8yrAemg95WdBVYVvhQMdOHULuivD17uaUZfkIibvgljcnZ0JKs9PxtHjV59qFf16_bYQSF', 'width': 3024}, {'height': 2603, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113896347171464562387"">julee wooley</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU7Q6H2_3BTXtv2FzL2Xvh7_lQk_B7hJXCM_kmQ-BB4cIayrpETYDHVVgOGy4yFLvoSItzTrgQPZX7sX7oywpI1r3wAeRKiA-TUmnRRiMCtN17QlH2fsWlxaDwmH8hhwjZ3vQ_SLV1f6XreIoOgXsF8HECYLxIND_vRlvFeFQjOTZgsbSKYG8XwnMvVQrAo2n8kn0-H1vA3easqCuiSt_0tTWemNYhiQ1_qIRZnU1tqkf0AsquYWTNNquyNTcSVkRbViMZANFVX7bCS_JpVH61vEiRhANKYz3OMUxgrJ7SlfJbDoxkMfgNIL6IiWXo4c_ZDXoUWfxtl2mrgqyS09T_DwVpp_y8SYDtdqeCSGHzCBHDhbU7gTSD8_K3wvQ-ReGMaN87BPoDtKkUNYnk7-E1l2VWKrWMQaSmupLuWlx2b7MrXi', 'width': 2603}, {'height': 4800, 'html_attributions': ['<a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/104851369133630995580"">Elizabeth Jordan</a>'], 'photo_reference': 'AWn5SU5mXeqjt2AYqI1q3qXIVuRhjj7LYqhiwKj7H-oh4P0K_sLbXD2Y2l9fNCEXycL2TvYGkSo4U0zO9MxzNM5fIwpW4khQwLZCg7bnh3QGum5LfLOMoMzJi2xyQaNFHW0DyJSzJD6tnmaX-NHG5ltxO1x3zNn1YaiGF4uwGWgFmZB7h8c9uYhzYBpmBWR2hxtPFOmxbelSCs9P4Z0hVb0-bflXvYbojYN8dz7J704eyfu41y0UZDvAzQ2_3ZwYuDNaPYBxi4092RQqc6mGz9xmAxAa1Ok9yCsQt-EqEDGfqdOa8z5wAJnxoCST9o1hrVoevrelG4EYyxZCHvTRit3KDjWqft7BJg3OSI9MT_05PpndrOJ73Hgd0Ekr2Y8BEhFmOU70_u_FtzNvXBej0WP6YWXblIhyBZgCRikooOh0FZdrHiiKWYfQ_PA0UInJ0bcX', 'width': 3199}]"
14,WARKA COFFEE,"Warka Coffee is not in the ""heart of Capitol Hill,"" but it does offer up close views of the U.S. Capitol. Opened in August 2025, I popped into Warka Coffee since I love a new coffee shop. Here's my experience.

1) Coffee: I ordered a large latte and it was good. It's darker than I usually enjoy, butWe had the smoked caramel iced latte with the avocado toast and nutty banana toast. The coffee has such a nice flavor, and very smooth! Food tasted good as well and there wasn't much of a wait to get our order. We really loved the cozy and homey ambiance, lots of natural light and greenery. Cute, unIt was such a wonderful experience, the ambiance was so chill and homey. I love the aesthetic. The food and coffee is amazing and the staff were very welcoming. Will definitely recommend and will definitely come back soon!!Lovely coffee shop! Very knowledgeable & friendly staff. The variety of coffee is perfectly simple without a bunch of overwhelming choices, yet still enough variety to accommodate everyone’s tastes. The atmosphere is cozy & comforting.

Little Hat Coffee
Washington, DC
April 24, 2025

Little Hat Coffee maybe small and sit quietly in the back corner of Streets Market, a neighborhood grocery store, but it’s serving up some mighty bold and big coffee!

The cortado was not only smooth with just the right balance of Little Hat Coffee is an absolute gem! The place has a warm, inviting vibe that makes you want to stay a while. The coffee is top-notch — rich, smooth, and clearly made with care. The baristas are friendly and always up for a quick chat or a great recommendation. I tried their cappuccino and it was pA coffee shop inside a market is always a good idea and Little Hat Coffee is worth a visit. Step inside Streets Market and head to the very back near the registers. Here you'll find a little coffee shop with bar seating only. The menu is small, but mighty. They have lattes, espresso, cappuccino, andOver a five-day visit I tried six espresso bars in D.C., and Little Hat was the clear standout by a wide margin. It is run by a young, switched-on crew pulling consistently excellent shots. This is not the place for a Starbucks-style frappuccino.

We could not pick and choose which dish was the best. I also can’t forget the coffee was excellent and the pastries were good. Thank you Yours cafe.Yours Coffee has an easygoing, calm vibe that makes it a great place to relax or get some work done. The atmosphere feels a little old-school in the best way — cozy, inviting, and comfortable.

The food is excellent — fresh, well-prepared, and presented beautifully. From hearty salads to comforting I had such a wonderful experience at Yours Coffee! From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I ordered the Warm Cinnamon Roll Latte with almond milk, and it was absolutely divine — perfectly balanced with cinnamon and white chocolate, smooth, and served piping hot in the cuAmazing breakfast spot! The food was fresh and delicious, portions were generous, and the coffee was perfect. The place is clean, cozy, and has a great vibe. Service was friendly and fast.

18,The Alchemist DC,"This is another speakeasy vibe bar with delicious and creative drinks. The place doesn’t serve food but has chips to buy! We went here for Happy hour and stayed on a bit longer to try other drinks on the menu. The menu had creative drinks were a fun treat for the eyes and the palette. I started off I stumbled upon The Alchemist while looking for speakeasy-style bars in DC, and I'm so glad we stopped by! The drinks had very creative names, and the presentation of them made the experience all the better! Not to mention the taste - every drink I tried was delicious! It was such a phenomenal find I didn't rate ""food"" because they only serve drinks. There is a Jumbo Slice pizza not far away, though. I don't drink alcohol often these days. HOWEVER, the drinks here are absolutely S-tier and worth it. Despite the theatrics, of which my cousin was obsessed with, I thoroughly enjoyed the drinks I The drinks are tasty and fun. The atmosphere was nice and I could see it being regular spot if the price wasn't so high. It feels predatory to have no prices on the menu when the drinks are $20+ each. We got 2 drinks and with the auto 20% gratuity our bill was $65...The staff were quick with the drinks, and each wad delivered with wonderful showmanship (in addition to the delicious smoke scent).

19,Code Red,"A truly one-of-a-kind speakeasy! This hidden gem offers an unforgettable experience from the moment you walk in. The ambiance is captivating—moody, stylish, and perfectly curated to transport you to another time. The vibe is effortlessly cool, with just the right balance of sophistication and edge. My friends and I visited on a Friday evening and nothing disappointed us. We were a group of 7 and got a section that everyone was able to enjoy and be comfortable in. Our waiter Emilio was amazing, he was attentive and friendly. The $1 oysters were a hit, briny and a good size. The food was quick tRED ALERT! CODE RED is a total VIBE and one of DC’s best hidden gems!

My friend and I hit up CODE RED in Adams Morgan to celebrate Mardi Gras—and WOW, what a night!

This speakeasy-style bar is tucked away behind an unassuming steel door, but trust me, what’s behind it is pure magic. From the momenAwesome spot!! Mark at the door was super welcoming even though I didn't have a reservation and took the time to explain how the menu worked, which I really appreciated. The bartender was personable, easy to chat with, and made wonderful drinks (both on and off the menu).  Lastly, the vibe of the plThis is such a fun place to eat dinner. The speak easy vibes are fun and even had live music. The food was pretty good. A little disappointed in the portion sizes, small portions at a higher price. The crème brûlée was lacking flavor, not the best by far.

There are a number of bars in the Convention Center area worth checking out. Lost and Found is certainly one of them!Underwhelming bar...even though the drink list looks pretty good.

22,Service Bar DC,"I think the server was having a bad day or had other personal things going on because they were pretty short and were not too helpful when we had questions. The establishment, however, probably had the best chicken tenders I've ever tasted with house made ranch, honey mustard, a Chipotle like sauce,This is going to be our new go to bar before going to see shows at DC9, The Atlantis, or 930 Club. Drinks here are amazing, the fried chicken is fantastic, and the happy hour deals aren’t bad. We really enjoyed the laid back vibe, and I was a huge fan or the mostly late aughts pop punk music playingTop notch. Chic bar with just enough grunge to know I don't need to be dressed to the nines to sit down for a unique drink one can't find elsewhere. It's not just about nuanced flavors of ingredients like mushroom butter and acorn liquer that seem like they shouldn't go together, but do. It's about Noisy but otherwise incredible. The cocktails are fantastic and well balanced. The fried chicken? Soooo good. Great sides and I'm not usually a Mac n cheese guy. Server took great care of us. Definitely will be back.An absolute gem. The welcoming nature coziness, and reasonable prices of a great neighborhood bar combined with a menu full of great cocktails - both solid classics as well as a number of unique creations with great flavors.

The service is top notSometimes you go somewhere and it is so good you know you want to stop by each time you are in town. Barmini was so phenomenal that from the moment we had our first sip we were planning a future trip solely around being able to come in and experience the magical drinks, service, and food once again.This place is a gem in all the ways - thoughtful, creative craft. Every drink is delicious and the little bites are so yummy and with an excellent presentation. The drink menu is inventive and unending in options.

Great ambience and darker lighting sets a good mood and atmosphere. Love it here and continue to bring friends to enjoy the gem close to DuPont!I just picked this bar because I could get to it quickly from where I was based, and I heard they served late night food. I'm so glad I did. Turns out they serve food all night! So even though it was after 10pm when I arrived, I could get a full delicious double patty burger. Unfortunately, I ate itI liked this place! Lovely decor and vibe, cozy with a vintage feel. We had a double date here. The menu is extensive, and both drinks I had (Paloma and Naked and Famous) were quite good.

25,Gypsy Kitchen DC,"I came here to have lunch or brunch with my family around 1 p.m. The hostess told us there was a 30-minute wait, so we waited at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender was a super friendly guy. We immediately felt welcomed.

I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious, with great flavors and quality that truly stood out. The prices were very reasonable, offering excellent value for the quality of the dishes.

A beautiful restaurant with delicious food! We always sit on the patio upstairs and the ambience is unmatched. A must have is the lamb hummus, which blows our minds every time. The sangria is delicious and we went during cherry blossom time and they had some delicious cherry blossom themed cocktailsFood is great, I especially like the Mussels, their soup base makes it so good and the mussels are fresh. They have lots of seats but still very busy. Our service was okay but for some reason, he seemed very unhappy and annoyed even though he barely stop by.For summer brunch, we recommend the lamb hummus (comes with seasoned pita), the tomato salad, the french toast and the shakshouka. Our server was very helpful for recommendations and the ambiance of the restaurant is warm and comfortable.
